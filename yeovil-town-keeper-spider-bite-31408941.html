Despite keeping a clean sheet, many didn't know that the day started off horrendously for the goalkeeper who woke up with a bite on his head.</p><p>Day didn't think much of it but following his side's victory, the bite swelled up to a point that he was forced to go to A&E. Upon inspection, doctors came to the conclusion that it was a spider bite as the Brighton native spent the next two nights in hospital receiving treatment.</p><p><b>READ MORE:</b><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Ex-Premier League star worked in a petrol station after being released by Chelsea</a></b></p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Premier League cult hero Benjani's son shows he takes after dad with non-league beauty</a></b></p><p>"The most likely cause of the bite, the doctor did reckon it was the reaction they'd expect from a bad false widow bite," Day told BBC Radio Somerset. Despite the brief hospital stay, Day was on hand to play 90 minutes in the Glovers' FA Cup win over Gateshead three days after the arachnid struck.</p><p>He stated that false widow spiders are a common sight around his house, but admitted: "I've never reacted to a bite like this in my life." Doctors had to drain the bite because of the size it swelled up to as he was given antibiotics from a drip.</p><p><b><i>Is that the strangest injury you've seen a footballer suffer?
