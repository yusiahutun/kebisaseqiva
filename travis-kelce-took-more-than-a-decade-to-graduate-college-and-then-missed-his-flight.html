Before he began his football career and joined the Kansas City Chiefs in 2013, he was a student. <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> lived in a house with his older brother Jason and some of their friends. Ironically, the sportsman’s girlfriend <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> managed to get a ‘degree’ before he did – and she didn’t even go to college!</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1687723541-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-did-travis-kelce-go-to-college-and-what-did-he-study>Where did Travis Kelce go to college and what did he study?</h2><p>Travis attended college two years after his older brother <a href=#>Jason Kelce</a> in 2008 and studied at the University of Cincinnati. He gained a degree in Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies from the College of Arts and Sciences. However, as he was pulled away from his learning by the NFL, he still had some left to do. In 2022 he completed his remaining credit hours and finally graduated.</p><p>During the latest podcast episode of New Heights, the <a href=#>celebrity</a> and his brother were confirming or denying rumors, and one of them was whether Travis Kelce did in fact graduate college.</p><p>It turns out the Chiefs tight end missed out on his own big day.</p><p>“Travis missed his flight for – well, we already know that’s true,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> Jason, 36, “for the University of Cincinnati graduation. That happened way after the fact. But yes, that is in fact a true story.”</p><p>“Yeah,” 34-year-old Travis said. “I can’t [deny it]. I’ve got to confirm that one. That was a mess up on my behalf. And uh, thanks for the diploma. Thank you. Love you guys.”</p><p>Jason couldn’t help but chuckle at his brother’s slip-up.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-you-threw-me-under-the-bus>‘You threw me under the bus’</h2><p>It’s not the first time they’ve brought up Travis Kelce not being able to graduate college because of his mishap.</p><p>In the brothers’ Prime Video documentary, Kelce, the older sibling wanted to rub it in again.</p><p>“You’re gonna throw me under the bus like that?” Trav says, annoyed as they work in the yard.</p><p>“You missed it! Took him 12 years to graduate” The center says, chuckling to himself for winding up his younger brother.</p><p>“I didn’t miss [my graduation]. Everyone has missed a flight before,” Travis yells.</p><p>They then discuss what Travis Kelce studied at college, and the tight end discusses his major was criminal justice. The 34-year-old then admits it wasn’t easy ‘to get out of there in 5 years’ with a tough major like that one.</p><p>He then defends his choice of major, saying: “I didn’t know what I wanted to learn, so I thought I might as well learn the law. Stay out of jail, Jason. Have you seen me in cuffs before? No.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-s-honorary-degree>Taylor Swift’s honorary degree</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1397957268-720x1024.jpg><p>Coincidentally, the same year, Taylor gained an honorary degree from New York University. She then gave a speech that lasted 20 minutes and encouraged students to strive to achieve doing the things they love but also reminded them making mistakes isn’t always a bad thing.</p><p>The <a href=#>music</a> star said in part: “I’m… 90% sure the main reason I’m here is because I have a song called ‘22’. And let me just say, I am elated to be here with you today as we celebrate and graduate New York University’s Class of 2022.</p><p>She said: “I know that words are supposed to be my ‘thing’, but I will never be able to find the words to thank my mom and my dad, and my brother, Austin, for the sacrifices they made every day so that I could go from singing in coffee houses to standing up here with you all today because no words would ever be enough.</p><p>“To all the incredible parents, family members, mentors, teachers, allies, friends, and loved ones here today who have supported these students in their pursuit of educational enrichment, let me say to you now: Welcome to New York.”</p><p>“It’s been waiting for you,” she said with a smirk referencing her track from 1989.</p><p>She concluded by referring to another one of her biggest hits. “I hope you know how proud I am to share this day with you. We’re doing this together. So let’s just keep dancing like we’re … the class of 22.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2d%2FcMDRmq2iq12gsq2vxGarqKebYrqwvsRmq6GZnmKubrDEnJidnV2pvG6z0Zqbrpmkmnqku8ulnKCdXZa7pXnToZynZZ2ewLSxw2afoqtdm7mqs8etZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftravis-kelce-took-more-than-a-decade-to-graduate-college-and-then-missed-his-flight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftravis-kelce-took-more-than-a-decade-to-graduate-college-and-then-missed-his-flight.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftravis-kelce-took-more-than-a-decade-to-graduate-college-and-then-missed-his-flight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftravis-kelce-took-more-than-a-decade-to-graduate-college-and-then-missed-his-flight.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftravis-kelce-took-more-than-a-decade-to-graduate-college-and-then-missed-his-flight.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftravis-kelce-took-more-than-a-decade-to-graduate-college-and-then-missed-his-flight.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./erin-and-ben-napiers-house-take-a-tour-of-their-mississippi-home.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./erin-and-ben-napiers-house-take-a-tour-of-their-mississippi-home.html>Erin and Ben Napiers House: Photos of Their Mississippi Home</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jennifer-hudson-flashes-cleavage-photoshoot-meatpacking-district-new-york-html.html>Jennifer Hudson flashes cleavage during a photoshoot in the Meatpacking District of New York</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jennifer-hudson-flashes-cleavage-photoshoot-meatpacking-district-new-york-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
