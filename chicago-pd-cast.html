<time>06 Oct 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Chicago PD — a stalwart of NBC dramas — has enjoyed great success and high ratings during the ten seasons it’s been on the air. Part of writer and producer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dick Wolf</a>’s Chicago trilogy – Chicago Fire and Chicago Med – the PD will enjoy a landmark 11th season with our favorite Chicago PD cast of characters.</p><p>Chicago PD follows the officers of the 21st District who are tasked with cracking some of the biggest cases in the Windy City.&nbsp;With no shortage of emergencies, the PD has its hands full — whether that includes investigating political corruption or tackling local gang violence. No matter what the 21st District is undertaking, the show finds the perfect blend between its procedural aspects and its character-driven drama.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>The Intelligence Unit and the uniformed cops are the two distinctly different groups on the series.&nbsp;Many of the show’s familiar faces have stuck with it from the very beginning, and like another one of Dick Wolf’s long running dramas — Law & Order: SVU — the continuity is what gives the series a long life.&nbsp; (Read about SVU’s <a href=#>Mariska Hargitay and her start in movies and TV shows</a>.) Here, catch up with the Chicago PD cast so you’re ready for their return!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where Season 10 left off</h2><p><strong>*Spoilers ahead* </strong>Season 10 had Detective Halstead leave for Bolivia, and his absence will most likely be addressed in season 11.&nbsp;Officer Ruzak was shot, so the question is whether or not he’s still alive.&nbsp;Because there were departures last season, that leaves room for someone moving up the ranks. So who is likely to make their way back for season 11?&nbsp; Let’s check out who’s who on the PD roster!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Chicago P.D. cast</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jason Beghe as Sgt. Hank Voight</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/NUP_201058_00449-edited.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Beghe</a> has been the lifeblood of the series, appearing as Sgt. Voight from the onset. He plays the dedicated commander of the Intelligence Unit of the district.&nbsp;It’s been noted through his story line that he always wanted to be a police officer and takes his job protecting Chicago citizens very seriously.&nbsp;Occasionally, Voight has had to bend the law, but his vigilance and harsh methods guarantees results.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the real life Beghe, you might remember him as a police officer in Thelma & Louise and other big screen films such as G.I. Jane and Monkey Shines.&nbsp;He also had recurring roles on Melrose Place and Californication, the latter starring his good friend, David Duchovy.&nbsp;</p><p>Beghe’s signature gravelly voice is due to a car accident in 1999.&nbsp; “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I was intubated and I kept pulling this tube out of my throat</a>,” he told New York Daily News.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Patrick John Flueger as Officer Adam Ruzek</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/NUP_199374_00014-edited.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Flueger</a> will most likely return in Season 11, as his role was one of the cliffhangers from season 10, where he was shot and last seen in the ICU.&nbsp;His entrée to the PD was as a promising candidate for the Intelligence Unit.&nbsp;Ruzek has a complicated relationship with his former partner, Officer Kim Burgess, and it’s been a puzzle whether the two will eventually tie the knot.&nbsp;</p><p>Fans have enjoyed watching how Officer Ruzek handles emergencies when he disagrees with Voight or Halstead — his answer is often to smoothly work around the legal system, which he manages to do so well. Off the PD roster, Flueger is recognized for his lead role as Shawn Farrell in the TV series, The 4400.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>LaRoyce Hawkins as Officer Kevin Atwater</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/NUP_199869_00589-edited.jpg><p>Officer Atwater joined the Chicago PD to get away from the criminal lifestyle many of his relatives were a part of.&nbsp;He has proven himself to be one of the most understanding officers on the team. He’s a sympathetic character — not only is he the legal guardian of his siblings, but he helps employ ex-cons and is always there to help those in need.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LaRoyce Hawkins</a> was raised outside of Chicago, living with his grandparents, who he credits with guiding and shaping his life. He excelling in high school basketball, but he deviated and took another route — that of comedy.&nbsp;In 2005, he won the state title in the Illinois High School Associations’ Original Comedy event.&nbsp;Then, he segued into theatre arts on a full tuition scholastic scholarship at Illinois State University, and during this time, he landed his first major film role in The Express: The Ernie Davis Story.&nbsp;Prior to joining the PD, Hawkins appeared in various TV series such as Ballers and Tyler Perry’s House of Payne.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Amy Morton as Desk Sgt. Trudy Platt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/NUP_200562_00356-edited.jpg><p>What would the 21st District precinct be without desk sergeant Trudy Pratt’s no-nonsense and often abrasive attitude? Though she sits behind the desk, Sgt. Platt is front and center, able to keep her fellow officers in check.&nbsp;She was cast as Sgt. Platt in 2014 as a recurring character in both Chicago Fire and Chicago PD, but was promoted from recurring guest star to series regular in the cast from the second season on in Chicago PD.&nbsp;Platt passed the detective test not once, but twice — yet a work-related injury keeps her at the precinct’s desk, instead of joining the rest of the crew on the front lines.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy Morton’s</a> pedigree hails from Broadway, but she also appeared in a number of films such as Straight Talk, 8mm, Up In The Air and The Dilemma.&nbsp;TV appearances include Crime Story, ER, Private Practice and more.&nbsp;Morton is a Tony Award nominee for her Broadway runs in August: Osage County and Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jesse Lee Soffer as Det. Jay Halstead</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/NUP_194731_2721-edited.jpg><p>Det. Halstead was seen in Chicago Med as the brother of Dr. Will Halstead.&nbsp;The detective was a former U.S. Army Ranger in Afghanistan and an experienced marksman who comes to the PD as part of the Intelligence Unit.&nbsp;Halstead’s tough exterior is often at odds with his gentler side, typically displayed around those close to him.&nbsp;While Soffer won’t be coming back for Season 11, he has set his sights behind the camera, making his directorial debut on a recent episode of Chicago PD.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jesse Lee Soffer</a> might be remembered for his six years on the soap opera, As The World Turns, as Will Munson, but he actually began his acting career in 1993 at age 8 in the comedy Matinee.&nbsp;He left the daytime drama in 2010.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tracy Spiridakos as Det. Hailey Upton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/NUP_200843_00085-edited.jpg><p>Hailey Upton is Halstead’s partner on the force. She had a traumatic childhood which lead her to becoming a cop. We love her because of her honesty and determination to help others, including her fellow officers.&nbsp;She was promoted to a series regular in the Chicago PD cast in the fifth season.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tracy Spiridakos</a> made her first starring role in 2009’s Majority Rules!&nbsp;In 2011, she made her feature film debut with Rise of the Planet of the Apes, with various other feature and television appearances.&nbsp;More recently, Spiridakos guest starred in Showtime’s Episodes. Spiridakos identifies strongly with her Greek heritage and speaks fluent Greek.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Marina Squerciati as Officer Kim Burgess</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/NUP_199706_00644-edited.jpg><p>As a patrol officer on Chicago PD, Burgess quickly became a fan favorite in the cast.&nbsp;Her sensitivity and kindness within the Intelligence Unit has enabled her to handle challenging situations with ease.&nbsp;</p><p>A New York native, actress Marina Squerciati made her feature film debut in It’s Complicated in 2009. She then appeared in Alter Egos and Frances Ha in 2012.&nbsp;Her TV debut was on Law & Order: Criminal Intent in 2009, followed by guest roles in The Good Wife, Blue Bloods and Law & Order: SVU.&nbsp;In 2013, she guest starred on the FX series The Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What the Chicago P.D. cast says about Season 11</h2><p>When is&nbsp;Chicago P.D.‘s Season 11 release date? As of writing this, NBC hasn’t confirmed the release date for&nbsp;Chicago P.D.&nbsp;Season 11 yet. However, Deadline reported on October 4 that the writers had returned to work for all three One Chicago shows — Chicago Fire, Chicago P.D. and Chicago Med — after the writer’s strike ended and the Writer’s Guild of America reached an agreement on September 27.</p><p>The&nbsp;Chicago P.D.&nbsp;cast also told the&nbsp;Chicago Sun Times&nbsp;in October 2023 that the series was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">getting “closer” to returning </a>amid the SAG-AFTRA strike, which is still ongoing.&nbsp;“I know we’re getting closer and closer to being back on the battlefield,” said LaRoyce Hawkins, who plays Officer Kevin Atwater. “The text thread is starting to get more active.” Hawkins also confirmed that he’s been in touch with staff members from&nbsp;Chicago P.D.‘s production. So we have hope it will return very soon!</p><p><strong>For more TV stories, click through below!</strong></p><p><a href=#>Get to Know The ‘Wednesday’ Cast + Everything We Know About Season 2</a></p><p><a href=#>Catch Up With ‘The Mandalorian’ Cast — And Find Out All We Know About Season 4</a></p><p><a href=#>‘1923’ Was One Of The Most Expensive Shows Ever Made + More Cast and Season 2 Facts</a></p><p><a href=#>12 Startling Behind-the-Scenes Secrets You Didn’t Know About ‘Desperate Housewives’</a></p><p><a href=#>‘Supernatural’ Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonKeslafBorXNppynrF%2BYtaqvwKCmZqiUYrCiv9M%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchicago-pd-cast.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchicago-pd-cast.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchicago-pd-cast.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchicago-pd-cast.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchicago-pd-cast.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchicago-pd-cast.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./comme-des-garcons-sale-050311.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./comme-des-garcons-sale-050311.html>Comme Des Garcons Clothing Sale at Croatian Church NYC</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./clerenda-harris.html>Who is Clerenda Harris dating?
