It is virtually impossible to turn funds over to trust personnel and/or attorneys that, to the best of our knowledge, have never existed until day before yesterday. Repeated attempts were made to Mr. Barley to have his trust team and attorney contact us, if in fact, they existed. We received contact from a personal attorney for the first time, day before yesterday (Thursday), that works in a firm with trust attorneys.</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>During the course of the GoFundMe campaign, a neutral third-party, unknown to both Fred and I, reached out to Fred in order to connect him with former professional athletes, in an effort to help him navigate his new-found notoriety. After speaking with this third-party, Fred and I both agreed that it would be in his best interest to allow one of these individuals to guide him and help him assist him with the donations from the GoFundMe campaign. As the days went on, this third party began to question Mr. Fred Barley’s actions and behaviors. Subsequently, this third-party decided to suggest to the former athletes that they step away from the situation. Thus, this has fallen back in my lap, as I am the organizer of the GoFundMe campaign.</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>With integrity and transparency of the campaign in mind, I then proceeded with the plan that all parties had agreed upon from the start of the campaign – to continue with setting up an educational trust. Mr. Fred Barley posted publically that he would not “sign off” on any trust that is set up outside of using his own trust officials and lawyers; this obviously tied my hands and the hands of any willing trust attorney. Since the professional athletes that previously agreed to assist in this, were no longer involved and no trust attorney representing Mr. Fred Barley had yet contacted us, on behalf of Fred, these events had placed me, as the GoFundMe campaign organizer with this responsibility.</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>The GoFundMe that I selected on the GoFundMe campaign site, when setting up the campaign, was the option of education/educational purposes. There are legal parameters inherent to that and I am required to follow those; they are a shaping force that dictates how we are to proceed. I have never, and have no intentions of ever being listed on, or in control of the educational trust. Hopefully, within the next few days, we will receive an initial proposal from Mr. Fred Barley’s attorney, to create a trust. That is our understanding of the next step.</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>Once a trust has been created, GoFundMe will have the final decision as to whether to release those funds to the trust.
