Watching him when he was just seven inspired him to go outside and practice.</p><p>Aside from that, Minamino’s family was also supportive of his growing passion for the game. Likewise, Takumi’s older brother <strong>Kenta</strong> also inspired him to play sports.</p><p>On many occasions, he would defy his brother’s orders and follow him to training and play against older and stronger opponents than him.</p><p>Nonetheless, Takumi showed signs of his talent and determination, which barely went amiss with his parents.</p><p>In fact, when they were young, his father would put cones down in a car park for them to dribble in and out of at speed.</p><p>Similarly, Takumi graduated from Osaka-Kokoku High School. As for his nationality, he is Japanese, while his ethnic background is Asian.</p><h2>How tall is Takumi Minamino?- Age and Height</h2><p>Known for his impeccable footwork and speed, Takumi Minamino was born in 1995, making him 26 years old. The Japanese athlete celebrates his birthday every year on the 16th of January, under Capricorn’s sign.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Takefusa Kubo Age, Stats, Current Teams, Villarreal, Transfer, Net Worth, Salary >></a></h4><p>Aside from his passion and dedication to sports, his physical build has held him stable for the position. Agile and coordinated with his body, Takumi stands at 5 feet 9 inches(174 cm) and weighs 67 kg.&nbsp;</p><p>In many cases, his techniques and how his body aligned, leg stretched, and understanding of the game has played a big part in the win. We are sure Minamino follows a strict diet and workout regime for sound health.</p><h2>Takumi Minamino- Professional Career and Stats</h2><p>Following his tenacious progress in the field, Minamino joined the Cerezo Youth team at 12. In August 2009, the young Takumi participated in Japan’s U15 Club Youth Soccer Championship Tournament and helped his team land eighth place.</p><p>Despite being eliminated in the quarter-finals, Takumi ended as the tournament’s top scorer with eight goals.</p><p>Likewise, in 2011, Takumi moved to the Cerezo Osaka U18 team and participated in the Takamadomiya Cup JFA U-18 Soccer Premier League.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Takumi-Minamino-Rolling-Football-228x300.jpg><p>This time, Minamino became the fourth top scorer with nine goals. Finally, after two years of being in the youth teams, in August 2012, he was registered to the first team.</p><p>Then on November 17, 2012, Takumi made his official debut as the substitute for Takuma Edamura.</p><p>The next month, he scored his first Cerezo goal and helped his team win over Shimizu S-Pulse in the fourth round of the Emperor’s Cup.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2013, Takumi made it into the first team and even became the first player from the club’s youth system to play in the opening game against Albirex Niigata.</p><p>That same year he also became the youngest scorer in the club’s history. By the end of the season, Minamino had made 38 appearances and scored eight goals.</p><p>Takumi’s 2014 season started well as he made his AFC Champions League debut against Pohang Steelers.</p><p>This season also became hectic for Takumi as he struggled to control his aggression and ended up with fouls or red cards.</p><p>In a 0-0 draw against Ventforet Kofu, Takumi was heavily criticized for his performance, especially his inability to defend in the left-wing position.</p><p>In a way, this season was a roller coaster not only for Minamino but also for his team. By the end of the 2014 season, Minamino had appeared in 42 games and scored eight times in all competitions.</p><h2>From National to International Clubs</h2><p>Despite his rocky end in 2014, Minamino’s performance at Cerezo Osaka’s Academy has been impressive enough for European clubs to show interest in him.</p><p>Even in Japanese football, which focused heavily on teamwork and hard-press, Takumi managed to stick out with his aggressive style and skills.</p><p>Hence, it did not take long for Red Bull Salzburg to sign him for a year that ran from January 7, 2015, to 2018. Similarly, Takumi made his debut on February 13, 2015, as a substitute in a match against Wiener Neustadt.&nbsp;</p><p>It was also in Salzburg that Minamino matured as a player and honed his defensive skills.</p><p>Blessed with agility and pace, Minamino learned to channel his aggression for the ball into tactical pressing. Other than that, he also learned when to tackle and how to keep his cool.</p><p>The former coach, <strong>Peter Zeidler,</strong> described his style as meticulous. He said, “He’s very disciplined and always wants to do everything exactly as it is explained to him.”&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, the current Red Bull Salzburg also shared the same sentiment when it came to Takumi. Speaking to ESPN, he said,</p><h3>“He understands football, he understands how to make final plays and tactics. Knowing Taki, he’s a guy who has so much drive and will find a way to get better every day.”</h3><p>Having said that, Takumi again returned the favor to the team by helping them dominate the game in both domestic and international turfs.</p><h2>Takumi Minamino’s transfer to Liverpool</h2><p>If there is anything we have extracted so far, it is that Minamino is a player who is willing to work hard and put in his extra effort to ensure he meets expectations. Not only does he have fans to please to standards to meet as well.</p><p>Likewise, Takumi’s explosive style, pace, and tactical awareness that he honed even further in Salzburg made him a sight for several European clubs.</p><p>During Liverpool’s Champions League clash with Red Bull Salzburg, the fierce Japanese attacker caught the eyes of Jurgen Klopp, who stood transfixed and nodded in approval.</p><p>Takumi scored a goal against the reds, and that was all it took to change his fate. A couple of months later, in December 2019, Liverpool signed a <strong>7.25 million Euro</strong> release clause to bring Takumi to their club in January 2020.</p><p>With this, Minamino also became the first Japanese to represent Liverpool.</p><p>Since the match against Salzburg, Liverpool players have been raving about Takumi and urged Klopp to bring him in. But little did they know, Minamino had already been on the list of other big clubs.</p><p><strong>Christoph Freund</strong>, Salzburg’s sporting director, commented on Takumi’s transfer to Liverpool. He said,</p><h3>“The big clubs have been watching him and, if I was them, I’d have no hesitation to sign him. Takumi is ready to take the next step in January.”</h3><p>Right from his much-anticipated transfer to Liverpool, Takumi finally made his debut on January 5, 2020, in the club’s FA Cup win against Everton.</p><p>Following that, Minamino made his Premier League debut against Wolverhampton Wanderers on January 23, 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>However, his best performance so far has been against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, where Takumi managed two interceptions, three tackles, three dribbles, and one critical chance.</p><p>Even Klopp lauded Takumi’s after the match, hinting that is what he expected from the players.</p><p>But of course, getting into one of the top clubs means more effort and challenges on his way. With the likes of <strong><a href=#>Mohamed Salah</a>, </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Sadio Mane</a>, and <strong>Roberto Firmino</strong> ahead of him, it is unlikely for Takumi to surpass them.</p><p>Despite that, the 26-year-old is determined to be one of the best deputies the club could find. Apart from his contribution as a player, Minamino’s contract also helps Nike (Liverpool’s new kit suppliers) to gain a bigger audience and exposure.</p><h3>International Career- Japan’s National Team</h3><p>Not only has Takumi excelled as a member of internal clubs, but he has also represented Japan in U15 and U16.</p><p>Then in June 2011, Takumi became a part of the Japan U-17 national team for the 2011 U-17 World Cup. He appeared in four matches and scored a goal against New Zealand U17.</p><p>Likewise, in May 2014, Minamino was included in Japan’s senior team for a preliminary 30-man squad but failed to be cut.</p><p>The following year on October 13, he made his debut for Japan’s national team in a friendly match against Iran.</p><h2>Takumi Minamino | Injury</h2><p>As an athlete, Minamino has faced numerous injuries and bumps along his way. Initially, on August 18, 2013, Takumi Minamino faced a medial collateral ligament knee injury.&nbsp;</p><p>This eventually kept him away from the games for 37 days; thus, he missed six games. Following it, on February 16, 2015, Minamino struggled with a tear in the abductor’s muscle.</p><p>During that time, he was on the injured list for 43 days and missed ten games in total. As for his last incident, he faced thigh problems on Dec 13, 2019. Back then, he was out of games for 18 days and missed a game.</p><h2>What is Takumi Minamino worth? How much did Liverpool pay for him?</h2><h2><span>Already a favorite of many international clubs, Takumi has managed to earn a name for himself.</span></h2><p>Until now, he has played for many prominent clubs, from Cereza Osaka to now a top international club, Liverpool. As of now, Takumi’s net worth is estimated to be 6 million euros.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Takumi-Minamino-217x300.jpg><p>Likewise, Minamino’s market value is <strong>12.5 million euros,</strong> which increased after his transfer to Liverpool. It recently upgraded from<strong> 4.5 million Euros</strong>.</p><p>Having said that, Takumi has yet to reveal all his details when it comes to his income and salary.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howie Long Bio: Age, Career, Net Worth, College, Wife, IG Wiki>></a></h4><p>Aside from his salary, Minamino also makes additional from his endorsements and sponsorship deals. In fact, this renowned name has struck a deal with the global sports brand Adidas.</p><h2>Personal Life- Is he married or single?</h2><p>Takumi Minamino is a young man who is still single and has yet to find someone to share his life with. For now, the 25-year-old is busy making a stellar career in the European league and honing his skills.</p><p>As a matter of fact, Minamino is a Guinness World Records holder for getting the highest fives within a minute(187). he achieved such a feat by running at the Komagawa Shopping Street.</p><p>Likewise, Minamino is also bilingual and is fluent in Japanese, his native language, and German. Added to this, Minamino is a massive fan of the Japanese idol group AKB48.&nbsp;</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Instagram (<a href=#>takumi18minamimo_official</a>)-&nbsp; <i>1.1M </i>Followers<br>Twitter (<a href=#>takumina0116</a>)-&nbsp; 467.2k Followers</p><h2>Takumi Minamino | FAQs</h2><h3>Which jersey number does Takumi Minamino feature in the game with?</h3><p>Takumi Minamino features in jersey number 19 for the Southampton F.C. and number 9 for the Japan national football team.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunDAwKSspqFdoravrcyipahn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftakumi-minamino.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftakumi-minamino.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftakumi-minamino.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftakumi-minamino.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftakumi-minamino.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftakumi-minamino.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jon-b-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jon-b-net-worth.html>Who is Jon B.
