That sense of shock and horror is going to linger for some time to come,” said Mahmood, the MP for Birmingham Ladywood, who knows the victim and his family.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“I was able to video call him yesterday. He’s such a well-known and well-loved member of our local community, it’s very upsetting to see him bandaged up unable to see or use his hands.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“I actually received a WhatsApp message from his son when I was in parliament shortly after it happened. It started: ‘Shabana, my dad has been set on fire,’ and I didn’t know how to process that. At first I thought it must be his car.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The suspect was arrested by officers on Tuesday outside the same mosque while they were conducting inquiries into the incident. On Wednesday, police confirmed the man remained in custody after being arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. They said they could not speculate about the motive of the attack.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Shahbon Hussain, the lead coordinator of the local StreetWatch and a friend of the victim’s family, said: “At the moment he is not able to open his eyes. He’s undergoing various skin grafts as a result of the horrific injuries. It’s going to be a slow road to recovery and the family are traumatised by what happened.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>He said the man’s family ran out of the house when they heard him screaming after being set on fire, and a neighbour threw a bucket of water over him. “There is a massive sense of shock in the community, and if we need to have extra security outside the mosques, so be it,” he said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Mahmood praised the local community for rallying together in the hours after the attack to collect CCTV and doorbell camera footage. “When you see the video footage of the moment the victim literally comes ablaze, I’ll never forget those images and I don’t think anybody that’s seen those videos will ever be able to wipe them from our memories,” she said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Councillor Sharon Thompson, who represents the ward where the attack took place, said the incident had been devastating, adding: “But the community has been phenomenal.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>She noted a man had been arrested but that there was a particular concern in the community with Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting, starting. “There is still an element of fear and apprehension. Everyone is asking, how did this happen and why?”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Regarding the Ealing attack, Ch Supt Sean Wilson, of the Met’s West Area Command, told the BBC: “We completely understand the shock that resonated throughout the community following this incident.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“Despite a man having been arrested, we continue to be vigilant and urge local people to do the same.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“Highly visible patrols around Singapore Road will continue in the coming days to provide reassurance to local people and I urge anyone who is concerned to approach officers.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaK2bYrumw9JoaWlqY2S6or6Oa2lompmnuqq6xqGYpmWdpXqlsdKcqaKalah6tLHNrJxmp5ZiwKm7wqRkmqaUYrWwvtGoqWaZlqmys3nMmqVmq5WperC6jJ%2Bgq50%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbirmingham-mp-describes-sense-of-shock-and-horror-after-man-set-on-fire.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbirmingham-mp-describes-sense-of-shock-and-horror-after-man-set-on-fire.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbirmingham-mp-describes-sense-of-shock-and-horror-after-man-set-on-fire.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbirmingham-mp-describes-sense-of-shock-and-horror-after-man-set-on-fire.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbirmingham-mp-describes-sense-of-shock-and-horror-after-man-set-on-fire.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbirmingham-mp-describes-sense-of-shock-and-horror-after-man-set-on-fire.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./first-photos-baby-born-24-weeks-couple-pregnancy-announcement-17-years-infertility-went-viral-just-weeks-forced-deliver-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./first-photos-baby-born-24-weeks-couple-pregnancy-announcement-17-years-infertility-went-viral-just-weeks-forced-deliver-html.html>Dana Griffin-Graves' photos of baby born at 24 months go viral</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./adele-george-michael-tribute-watch-her-start-stop-swear-and-slay.html>Adele George Michael Tribute: Watch Her Start, Stop, Swear and Slay Grammy Performance!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./adele-george-michael-tribute-watch-her-start-stop-swear-and-slay.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
