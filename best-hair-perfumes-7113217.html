With that said, if you’re not one to say no to a bit of indulgence, hair perfumes, mists, and perfume oils can add a little je ne sais quoi to your whole deal, making your hair smell like a rose garden (Diptyque) or a day at the beach (Pacifica). Specially formulated for hair, these perfumes don’t smell as strong as perfume designed for skin, meaning they’ll make your hair smell lovely without totally overpowering you and those around you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, our favorite hair perfumes are formulated with extra hair-loving ingredients for achieving a shiny, smooth, soft, glowing mane. It also doesn’t hurt if they help protect your strands from the harmful effects of the sun, or if they work to neutralize undesirable odors as well. We also like to give out special props to products that are formulated with natural ingredients and little or no alcohol, to avoid drying out your hair wherever possible. After all, you shouldn’t have to sacrifice your hair health in order to smell delicious.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-moroccanoil-hair-and-body-fragrance-mist></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Moroccanoil Hair and Body Fragrance Mist</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Moroccanoil Hair and Body Fragrance Mist" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qjT9Bs88xs6Z87o92ZWCU-dC6YE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/moroccanoil-hair-and-body-fragrance-mist-3ffc4a82ce0548baa2648e3b62fbb8dd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Moroccanoil&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It hydrates your hair and helps protect it from sun damage.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It doesn't last all day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You kind of can’t go wrong with a hair perfume that hails from a brand specializing in haircare like Moroccanoil, because you know they’ll have taken care to formulate a safe product that gives your hair a boost. “I absolutely love perfume and as a hairstylist I’m even more infatuated with making my clients’ hair look and smell amazing,” says Ebony Gordon, owner of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Hairista Studio</a> and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Hairista Essentials</a>. “My go-to hair fragrance has been Moroccanoil’s hair and body mist. Not only is it safe for hair, but the smell is a divine unisex scent great for all hair types.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Said scent blends amber, magnolia and woody notes for a sweet and spicy finish that’s not overpowering. Formulated without harsh chemicals including sulfates and parabens, this hair and body mist features argan oil for hydrating your strands, vitamin E for supporting a healthy moisture balance, and a sun-exposure absorber for protecting your hair from the drying effects of the sun. This product helps to freshen up your hair between washes, and leaves it looking shiny and soft without any oily residue. In short, this is a near-perfect hair perfume.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fragrance Notes: </strong>Amber, magnolia, cedarwood | <strong>Additional Benefits</strong>: Hydrates, nourishes, protects from UV damage |<strong> Color-Safe: </strong>Yes |<strong> Size: </strong>3.4 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-pacifica-indian-coconut-nectar-hair--body-mist></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pacifica Indian Coconut Nectar Hair & Body Mist</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pacifica Indian Coconut Nectar Hair &amp;amp; Body Mist" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ugmQevrpVqcZnst_p-HeNeUFmQo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pacifica-indian-coconut-nectar-hair--body-mist-b8b4d104b5a44cb2aa5ea56059d2963b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s made without alcohol and other harsh chemicals.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The scent disappears quickly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re obsessed with Pacifica for natural beauty products at accessible prices that also happen to smell absolutely delicious. This hair and body mist smells of sweet coconut, creamy vanilla and earthy vetiver, and is essentially summer in a bottle —&nbsp;especially for those short and dark days of winter when you may need a pick-me-up (or several) to avoid feeling a bit blah. Unfortunately, though, as is the case with many hair mists, the scent doesn’t linger for that long after application.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This perfume is vegan, cruelty-free, made with clean ingredients and packaged in a recycled and recyclable plastic bottle, all planet-friendly credentials that are pretty rare in more affordable cosmetics. Plus, this mist is alcohol-free to avoid drying out your hair, and is formulated without harsh parabens, phthalates, or propylene glycol. This means that, although this spray isn’t designed to enhance your hair health, it also won’t damage it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lastly, if coconut isn’t your thing, the brand makes this hair and body mist in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">a ton of other scents</a> inspired by faraway destinations, including Tuscan blood orange and Tahitian gardenia.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fragrance Notes: </strong>Coconut, vanilla, vetiver | <strong>Additional Benefits</strong>: Doesn't dry out hair |<strong> Color-Safe: </strong>Yes |<strong> Size: </strong>6 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-lasting-hair-perfume-byredo-mojave-ghost-hair-perfume></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long-Lasting Hair Perfume</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Byredo Mojave Ghost Hair Perfume</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Byredo Mojave Ghost Hair Perfume" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/g19A5eOI7FsH6UMeszYwmsvF2Dg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/byredo-mojave-ghost-hair-perfume-29ef01558dde4a78be7145f28055b14e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It looks, feels and smells luxurious.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It doesn’t have any real hair benefits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re going to spend a bit more on a hair perfume, you very naturally will want the scent to linger all day long (or even until wash day) so that you get your money’s worth. We’re glad to say that this is most definitely the case with this Byredo product, which was recommended by Gordon. “Another favorite of mine is Byredo’s Mojave Ghost because I love the idea of matching my body and hair scents to give a luxurious vibe to any outfit,” she explains.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The scent is a complex composition inspired by the Mojave Desert (obviously), which gives off woody notes and an allure of mystery. While you’ll need to look elsewhere if you want your hair perfume to enhance your hair health, this product has the distinct advantage of not weighing down or drying your hair, as well as refreshing your strands when you don’t have time for a proper wash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fragrance Notes: </strong>Ambrette, Jamaican naseberry, violet, sandalwood, magnolia, musk, amber | <strong>Additional Benefits</strong>: Long-lasting, designed to release scent throughout day |<strong> Color-Safe: </strong>Yes |<strong> Size: </strong>2.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lightweight-diptyque-eau-rose-hair-mist></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lightweight</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Diptyque Eau Rose Hair Mist</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Diptyque Eau Rose Hair Mist" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/SzRBLx41YZqvOqULIDUihgp3t28=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/diptyque-eau-rose-hair-mist-0892e94032094837bd86725f0e42772c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It smells really fresh and lovely.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> You don't get a ton of value from the small bottle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the most important factors to keep in mind when choosing a hair perfume is that the scent isn’t too sickly for you —&nbsp;because it sits super close to your nose all day and could be really uncomfortable if you decide you don’t like it. That’s where cult candle brand Diptyque’s hair mists are great. The Eau Rose scent is especially lightweight, designed to refresh and perfume your hair without smelling too strong, but while still boasting staying power. This one smells of light, feminine roses, with notes of sweet lychee and woody ambroxan.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, this Diptyque hair mist is formulated with less alcohol to avoid over-drying your hair, and infused with camellia oil, which helps to nourish and protect your hair from damage. The bottle is a little small, but most people find you only need a spritz or two to get the scent you’re looking for.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fragrance Notes: </strong>Rose damascena, rose centifolia, lychee, ambroxan | <strong>Additional Benefits</strong>: Nourishing, protective |<strong> Color-Safe: </strong>No |<strong> Size: </strong>1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hair-mist-perfume-for-curly-hair-gisou-honey-infused-hair-perfume></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hair Mist Perfume for Curly Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gisou Honey Infused Hair Perfume</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gisou Honey Infused Hair Perfume" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lZWujSYG0r0iHnY97UU_P1-4v7M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gisou-honey-infused-hair-perfume-e64eb708abfc4c87be00b149c40d7b55.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>We can’t get enough of the sweet and citrusy scent.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It contains alcohol.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re huge fans of supermodel Negin Mirsalehi and her gorgeous line of hair care products, Gisou, which is inspired by her family’s rich history of making honey: The model is a sixth-generation beekeeper, and also happens to boast enviable luscious locks. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Heather Bassano</a>, hairstylist and owner of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Manuka Salon</a>, calls the scent "incredible, with notes of sweet honey and citrus, and it also delivers the benefits of UV protection and shine."

The star ingredient, Mirsalehi honey, works to counteract the drying effects of alcohol by nourishing the hair and restoring its moisture balance. The formula is also free of other harsh ingredients including parabens, sulfates, phthalates and more, and the product is certified cruelty-free.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fragrance Notes: </strong>Honey, spring florals | <strong>Additional Benefits</strong>: Adds shine, hydrates, strengthens hair follicles |<strong> Color-Safe: </strong>Yes |<strong> Size: </strong>3.4 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dry-hair-chanel-coco-mademoiselle-hair-perfume></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Dry Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chanel Coco Mademoiselle Hair Perfume</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Chanel Coco Mademoiselle Hair Perfume" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GIGM2Nv_mZStS7lYNCqL0vUX3UI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/chanel-coco-mademoiselle-hair-perfume-126c9ef0e6414b6789d0c1d4d00e6b00.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s lightweight, yet the scent lasts all day long.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The bottle is small, especially for the price.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Darryl Do, a perfumer at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Delbia Do Fragrances & Flavors</a>, is a big fan of Chanel’s range of hair perfumes, because they’re formulated with dicaprylyl carbonate and glycerine, both of which help to prevent your hair from drying out, and help to promote softness.

Although this particular product from celebrity hairstylist Jen Atkin’s award-winning brand isn’t technically a hair perfume, Bassano finds it totally might as well be. “I instantly fell in love with the scent of this product,” she says. “It smells like a garden full of gardenias, and even though it's not marketed as a hair perfume, it has such an incredible fragrance that I use it as such." Alongside gardenia, this one is scented with equally floral and lovely violet, ylang ylang, and white musk.

Phlur, by way of perfumer Clement Gavarry, has totally solved that problem, with this dreamy vanilla-based aroma that blends the sweet note into its deeper ingredients, like sandalwood and agarwood, creating a woodier, deeper effect. The heart notes are then more on the floral side, and the top notes are sweet and feminine. It’s complex and sophisticated, yet feels fun and nostalgic.

The fragrance is lightweight enough to not make you feel lightheaded —&nbsp;important when it’s meant for spritzing so close to your nose — though some people find it a little too lightweight for their taste, meaning the scent doesn’t linger. Still, this may depend on your hair type, because others find it smells lovely all day long. These things are personal, you know?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fragrance Notes: </strong>Blood orange, lily, white freesia, sandalwood | <strong>Additional Benefits</strong>: Moisturizing, boosts shine |<strong> Size: </strong>1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-woody-juliette-has-a-gun-not-a-hair--body-mist></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Woody</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Juliette Has a Gun Not A Hair & Body Mist</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Juliette Has a Gun Not A Hair &amp;amp; Body Mist" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Lq-z4GzKgKtIEAQk4fTcS8cfmVw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/juliette-has-a-gun-not-a-hair--body-mist-3fd42d9921e34a3ba1b2ee855b9a13c9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s planet-friendly thanks to its continuous atomizer spray.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The scent is quite subtle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those who love the deeper, more sensual feel of a woody fragrance — especially come fall and winter — Juliette Has a Gun has just the thing. Formulated with synthetic ambergris for a warm and woody smell, this mist features a continuous atomizer spray application that helps preserve the planet (i.e. instead of an aerosol system).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, the scent is really light, and works better layered with other Not a Perfume products than on its own. Still, some people find that lightweight scent hits the spot for them, so it’s really a matter of preference. Meanwhile, we’re handing out bonus points for this product being alcohol-free, which is a rarity in the hair perfume space.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fragrance Notes: </strong>Cetalox (synthetic ambergris) | <strong>Additional Benefits</strong>: Rebalances pH level in hair follicles |<strong> Color-Safe: </strong>Yes |<strong> Size: </strong>2.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hair-perfume-for-natural-textures-flora--curl-rosewater-curl-mist></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hair Perfume for Natural Textures</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Flora & Curl Rosewater Curl Mist</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Flora &amp;amp; Curl Rosewater Curl Mist" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/aKJMq4JEuLkxoMtjcntv7MfzDd0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/flora--curl-rosewater-curl-mist-8c48c25b5c064b50a9e96a1a0688ed7b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Flora & Curl</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s formulated with delicious-smelling natural ingredients that promote the health of your curls.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> You'll want to follow up with a more hydrating oil to keep strands nourished.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Those with type three or four curls should steer well clear of super drying ingredients and formulas, and instead opt for products designed to promote healthy, hydrated hair. On that front, this hair mist is super clever in that it’s formulated with a bunch of natural ingredients that smell divine as well as helping you keep your hair at its best. It features rose water for hydration, aloe vera for moisture, white jasmine oil for purifying the scalp, lavender oil for soothing the scalp, honey for softening your hair, and vitamin E for its antioxidant properties.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-95 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In short, this hair mist will leave your hair looking, feeling AND smelling amazing.

They strive to use organic, natural ingredients wherever possible, are certified vegan and cruelty-free, and manufacture their products locally in California. In line with the brand’s ethics, this hair fragrance doesn’t contain phthalates, BHT, parabens, petroleum, colors or dyes. It also comes in locally sourced, FSC-certified packaging, and finished with plant-based ink.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-101 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Scent-wise, this spray diffuses in a fine mist to cover more surface area, and smells like flowers with a base of coconut and rosewood. The scent lingers all the livelong day — just note that you should go with a different scent if you’re not into florals. This perfume is also formulated to refresh and nourish your hair between washes, and help tame frizz as well. Plus, it’s suitable for all hair types, including curls, and compatible with other hair products since it’s so gentle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-102 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fragrance Notes: </strong>Lilac, gardenia, ylang-ylang, freesia, coconut, rosewood | <strong>Additional Benefits</strong>: Anti-frizz, smoothing, hydrating |<strong> Color-Safe: </strong>Yes |<strong> Size: </strong>2 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Non-Drying Formulas</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For Bassano, it’s so important to choose a non-drying hair perfume, since otherwise it’s just like needlessly adding a potentially damaging factor to our hair. “Our hair already withstands a lot of sun exposure, time spent swimming, hot styling tools and air pollution,” she says. “All of those factors already take a toll on the hair, so when looking for a hair perfume, it is important to find a product that will only hydrate and protect the hair against these types of exposures.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That’s why you should never use regular perfume on your hair, because it typically contains a lot of alcohol, which can do a lot of harm to your strands. Instead, when shopping for hair perfume, “look for products with natural oils and extracts, as these will deliver natural fragrances,” says Bassano. “Ingredients like hyaluronic acid will hydrate the hair, which we love to see as an added benefit. I always love to look for clean products with a seal on the bottle that uses clean ingredients and is vegan and cruelty-free.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Scent Intensity</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because hair perfume is designed to sit so close to where your nose is, it’s super important that the scent isn’t too strong —&nbsp;however, hair perfumes often have the opposite problem, and don’t smell strong enough for some people.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Currently, there are fragrance industry regulations that limit the fragrance oil concentration to a lower limit than your perfume so you shouldn't worry about the strength being too much,” says Do.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Odor-Fighting Ingredients</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though alcohol in hair perfume is unfortunately drying, Do notes that this ingredient has the benefit of helping to minimize odors. But that’s not your only option: “I love a product rich in essential oils and extracts to refresh hair after a hard workout or for days two or three without washing,” says Bassano. “Many dry shampoos also have delightful fragrances to absorb sweat and leave the hair smelling fresh. My preference would be to apply a dry shampoo at my root followed by a perfumed oil through my ends.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Hair Benefits</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Many hair perfumes also offer great benefits for the health of your hair.

However, there are some products that are not only safe but actually extend the life of the hair color. These products protect your hair from the sun and air while also hydrating the hair.” If you’re concerned, opt for an alcohol-free product like our picks from Juliette Has a Gun and Kayali.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With all that said, while some hair perfumes may have a slight drying effect, that’s not to say that they’re unsafe per se. “As long as the brand is following industry regulations, the product should be safe,” says Do.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is hair mist the same as perfume?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hair mist implies that it’s a more lightweight product than perfume, but there’s no hard and fast rule here. “Hair perfume may be more concentrated than mist, but it seems to be a matter of semantics in most cases,” says Bassano. “Some products are marketed as hair and body mists to be used as both.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can you use hair mist as perfume?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While you shouldn’t use regular perfume as hair perfume, the reverse doesn’t hold true.
