<time>01 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Dimitri and Ashley Snowden have to be one of the most intriguing couples on the TLC reality TV hit Seeking Sister Wives. Their views on marriage and life, in general, might be a tad controversial, but their Bohemian-ish, earthly vibe makes them quite a match to watch.</p><p>Adding the gorgeous Vanessa Cobbs to their family dynamic got us even more hooked so it was quite the shock when it came out that she had left. So why did Vanessa leave the Snowden family?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why Aren‚Äôt Vanessa, Ashley, and Dimitri Together Anymore?</h2><p>Following their unique wedding, a question that often came up among fans is what religion are the Snowdens? Well, prior to the wedding, Dimitri and Ashley were not legally married and they are not affiliated with any religious group.&nbsp;</p><p>So why do they put a red dot on their forehead? Isn‚Äôt that some type of Indian religious symbol?</p><p>As Ashley explained, the dot symbolizes universal awareness, and wearing it helps them gain insight into this awareness.</p><p>She also pointed out that they‚Äôd require any prospective sister-wife to accept the family‚Äôs belief in spiritual awareness, something Vanessa seemed to vibe with.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, once Vanessa officially became a sister-wife in a bohemian wedding ceremony, she seemed to be settling in well into her new family. She was clicking with co-wife Ashley and she even agreed to detox and change her diet to suit the Snowdens‚Äô strict vegetarian lifestyle.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>The kids loved her too and it looked like they would all live happily ever after. That‚Äôs until, on the final episode of season two, Dimitri and Ashley revealed that Vanessa had actually left them shortly after the wedding celebration. Say what?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>So, Just What Happened to Vanessa and the Snowdens?</h2><p>On April 15, 2019, a day after the tell-all episode aired, the Snowdens took to Instagram and in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy statement</a> announced that they were ‚Äúdeeply saddened by Vanessa‚Äôs decision to leave the family.‚Äù</p><p>Just in case fans thought their family dynamic had anything to do with Cobb‚Äôs exit, the post went on to read ‚ÄúWe know that it‚Äôs not polygamy to blame, as one doesn‚Äôt blame monogamy when things don‚Äôt work out.‚Äù</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2021/03/non-monogamy.jpg><p>While they didn‚Äôt give an official explanation as to why the fan-favorite left them, the Snowdens simply said that they respected Vanessa‚Äôs choice, wished her all the best, and asked fans to do the same.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why Did Vanessa Leave Dimitri? The Real Reason</h2><p>In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">her own post</a>, Vanessa professed her love for polygamist husband Dimitri, sister-wife Ashley, and the kids but went on to say that she had ignored her ‚Äòinner guidance which was telling me that I do not belong with them in the capacity that they need me to.‚Äù</p><p>The reality-tv star further explained, ‚ÄúSometimes (people‚Äôs) long-established dynamic is not aligned with your own personal growth and path forward.‚Äù</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2021/03/vanessa-cobbs-facebook.jpg><p>That being said, chances are good that the gorgeous Vanessa left Dimitri because he had mentioned that he was on the lookout for a third wife.</p><p>Vanessa and Dimitri had not even gotten married yet and here was this guy already setting eyes on someone else. Although Ashley had no qualms with it, the idea must‚Äôve turned Vanessa off causing her to reconsider her union with the self-proclaimed polygamist.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ashley Might Have Been The Problem</h2><p>In other circles, fans think Ashley is the real reason why Vanessa left. Ashley always maintained that she wanted to handle the family business while her sister-wife helped with caring for the kids.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of bringing a third&nbsp;wife&nbsp;into their relationship seemed to suit Ashley pretty well because this way, her two sister wives could take care of her kids.</p><p>One wonders whether Ashely understood that her sister-wife would be her equal and not some unpaid domestic helper for her children.</p><p>Vanessa quickly formed a bond with the kids but this doesn‚Äôt mean she was up to the task of being a live-in babysitter with a polygamist lifestyle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2021/03/ashley-snowden.jpeg><p>From the look of things, it seems like the reason why Vanessa chose to break it off with Dimitri and Ashley had to do with compatibility issues. But, going by their separate posts, the breakup was amicable as they each wished each other well.&nbsp;</p><p>Ashley and Dimitri seemed pretty committed to adding a new wife to their life. However,&nbsp; after Vanessa ditched them, they have been quite lowkey and it doesn‚Äôt look like they are dating anyone for now.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where is Vanessa Cobbs Now?</h2><p>After vamoosing from our screens and the&nbsp;&nbsp;polygamous marriage, Vanessa made her way to Australia to relax and catch up with her twin sister who&nbsp;lives&nbsp;‚Äòdown under.‚Äô</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=in dir=ltr>Bali ‚úåüèΩüå±‚ú® <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/AnfMx7PuJA</a></p>‚Äî Vanessa Cobbs (@vanessa_cobbs) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">June 24, 2019</a></figure><p>Following the split, she took a hiatus from social media but soon returned with the news that she was in sunny Aussieland. A quick peek at her Instagram shows that she is still there (at the time of this writing) and seems to be loving it.</p><p>Will Seeking Sister Wives return for a third episode and will Vanessa be back? Well, word on the street is that TLC already put out a casting call for single women and families looking to be on the show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It only took me 18 years, but I finally worked up the nerve to get my helix pierced!

The star made it clear that she doesn‚Äôt know whether the show will return and went on to say that she will not be on it. So there you have it, kids!</p><p><strong>Update:</strong><br>Ashley confirmed in a social media post that the story continues:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2021/03/seeking-sister-wifes-season-3.jpeg><p>Although Ashley and Dimitri were devastated upon hearing Vanessa‚Äôs departure, they decided to return for season three of Seeking Sister Wife. It seems they just needed some time to heal before they could return to their polygamous life and find another special someone for their union.</p><p>In Dimitri‚Äôs Instagram sneak peek, he and Ashley reveal that they have started courting two new women following Vanessa‚Äôs departure.</p><p>Both will appear on the show. Dimitri and Ashley may get married again if either or both of them become part of Snowden‚Äôs ‚Äútribe.‚Äù</p><p>Brace yourself for another season of Seeking Sister Wife!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmsKCpYrGqsIyvmKedo6iubrjEmq2eZaSdsm6%2FzaiunZ2eqHw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-vanessa-leave-the-snowdens.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-did-vanessa-leave-the-snowdens.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-vanessa-leave-the-snowdens.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-did-vanessa-leave-the-snowdens.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-vanessa-leave-the-snowdens.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-vanessa-leave-the-snowdens.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./virginia-married-at-first-sight-alcoholic.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./virginia-married-at-first-sight-alcoholic.html>Married at First Sight: Fans ask Is Virginia an alcoholic as many are concerned!
