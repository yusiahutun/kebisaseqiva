The fragrance-free formula is gentle enough for sensitive skin, while being effective enough to serve as a steadfast serum in mature skincare routines. In that way, it’s a universally-appealing serum for any complexion or skincare regimen.&nbsp; Some rosacea sufferers had some flare-ups, though, many more claim that it’s plenty gentle. And when we tried it on our own sensitive skin, we had no qualms.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For best results, this serum should be applied to a damp face.

Truly, when using this serum, we marveled over just how hydrated our skin felt all day long. And after just a few weeks of use, we noticed that our breakouts were becoming less and less common. Suffice to say, you can’t go wrong with this HA serum.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Hyaluronic acid (low and medium molecular weight), biomarine, peptides, lentil extract |<strong> Skin Type: </strong>Combination, oily, dry<strong> </strong>| <strong>Best For: </strong>Dry, dull, acne-prone skin in need of a texture and hydration boost | <strong>Size: </strong>1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-vitamin-c-loreal-paris-revitalift-derm-intensives-vitamin-c-face-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Vitamin C</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Vitamin C Face Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Derm Intensives Vitamin C Face Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/q2E8ZMWIRczobvuTTZR5RseIX8E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/loreal-paris-revitalift-derm-intensives-vitamin-c-face-serum-647cf8e8c3984f47bdd5a790a8ab0a1f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s affordable, effective, and the packaging makes it easy to enjoy every last drop.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Immediately out of the tube, the serum’s texture is more like a paste.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we researched and tested the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>most popular vitamin C serums</a> on the market, we found the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift 10% Pure Vitamin C Face Serum to be the best of the best. Formulated with 10 percent pure vitamin C, the serum (which is more like a paste until it melts into your face) is a potent solution for brighter-looking skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not sure you need a brightening boost? Dr. Hartman advises it for just about everyone. “When applied topically, vitamin C reduces damage to our cells by neutralizing free radicals, which are highly reactive and harmful molecules formed by exposure to environmental stressors, such as pollution and UV light,” he says. The ingredient also inhibits melanin production, so it’ll help fade dark spots and hyperpigmentation, evening out the complexion.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Shamban says that the face should be completely dry, as vitamin C is notoriously unstable and could degrade if exposed to water, or even another skincare formula. “It should dry with a waiting period of two or three minutes before your layer of sunscreen or moisturizer,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Vitamin C, hyaluronic acid |<strong> Skin Type: </strong>Dull skin<strong> </strong>| <strong>Best For: </strong>All skin types but especially those experiencing dullness and/or dark spots | <strong>Size: </strong>1.76 oz<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-anti-aging-skinceuticals-c-e-ferulic></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Anti-Aging</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/X-Refy0SqfyJ7z5nOTRt2PyG1Rw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/skinceuticals-c-e-ferulic-1-fl-oz-31cb24d0649a4dd8ac9f7cb5da1cfd70.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bluemercury</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This formula absorbs quickly to provide protection against photoaging while treating past damage.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The smell leaves something to be desired.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s highly likely that you’ve heard of this fast-absorbing, water-like serum before, if not tried it for yourself. That’s because the highly-lauded formula is a staple of beauty editors and dermatologists alike. “This is just a basic, three-ingredient winner — and always has been,” says Dr. Shamban.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Those three ingredients are a cocktail of potent antioxidants: 15 percent l-ascorbic acid (the purest form of vitamin C), vitamin E, and ferulic acid. They work in tandem to defend skin from oxidative stress caused by exposure to sun and pollution while firming, brightening, and smoothing the complexion. Fair warning: The serum smells like hot dog water, but it does fade quickly on your skin, and the results make a few seconds of stink worth it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Vitamin C, vitamin E, ferulic acid<strong>｜Skin Type: </strong>Normal, dry, combination, sensitive, mature<strong>｜Best for:</strong> Softening fine lines, wrinkles, and dark spots<strong>｜Size:</strong> 1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hydrating-vichy-mineral-89-hyaluronic-acid-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hydrating</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vichy Mineral 89 Hyaluronic Acid Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vichy Mineral 89 Hyaluronic Acid Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2TXE6ayfmq4czOQyZbSoVLL24WA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vichy-mineral-89-hyaluronic-acid-serum-bdba879baabf4b09bebae5f8a8e2e6a3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s incredibly hydrating and makes skin look instantly plumper.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The gel-like serum takes a sec to really sink in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Vichy Mineral 89 Hydrating & Strengthening Daily Skin Booster is moisture magic for less than $30. The hypoallergenic, fragrance-free gel-like serum is formulated with hyaluronic acid and is designed to encase skin in long-lasting hydration. The serum is dermatologist-backed, too. It’s been clinically tested by 325 dermatologists on 3,200 women worldwide​, in which eight out of 10 women felt that their skin was smoother and healthier immediately post application. Meanwhile, after four weeks of use, nine out of 10 women felt their skin looked more luminous and glowing overall.

She recommends blends of ingredients like glycolic acid (AHA), salicylic acid (BHA), zinc, and tea tree oil. “Combinations here help to prevent buildup of dead skin cells, balance oils. and even help fade scars while minimizing redness, inflammation, and irritation,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With this in mind, the Glow Recipe Strawberry Smooth BHA + AHA Salicylic Acid Serum is a must.

To keep these signs of aging at bay, reach for the Drunk Elephant T.L.C. Framboos Glycolic Resurfacing Night Serum. It’s formulated with glycolic, lactic salicylic, hyaluronic, and tartaric acids to decongest pores, gently slough away dry skin, as well as hydrate and plump the skin.

We’re sold! Even if you’re in your 20s, Dr. Hartman recommends adding a retinol serum to your lineup. “My opinion is that with the exception of people with rosacea or overly sensitive skin, everyone should be using a retinol,” he says. “It’s arguably the most important step that you can take for overall skin health and anti-aging after sun protection factor.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, aside from SPF, retinol is probably the most studied ingredient in skincare, and is the only one that’s clinically proven to treat signs of aging — it regulates cell turnover, promotes exfoliation, evens tone, prevents acne, controls, oil, unclogs pores, and more.

Your goals — not the goals everyone’s speaking to on TikTok. “Following serum trends or choosing a serum based on an influencer recommendation is not always going to work for your specific skin needs,” says Dr. Hartman. With this in mind, think about how your skin performs on a monthly basis as well as how it is overall, and select your serums from there. “Some skin concerns are temporary, based on factors like seasonality, time of the month, lifestyle, nutrition, stress, and other factors, so as our skin changes, our need for boosting does too,” says Dr. Shamban.</li><li><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> The active ingredients to look for in a serum should always align with your unique&nbsp;complexion concerns — except for hyaluronic acid (for hydration) and antioxidants (to prevent and repair photodamage), which everyone can and should use. As a general rule of thumb, if you have dull skin, an uneven tone, or dark spots, look for a serum with vitamin C and/or niacinamide; if you’re concerned about aging or wrinkles, retinol and retinol alternatives are worthwhile; if you struggle with acne, ingredients like glycolic acid and salicylic acid can work wonders. (FYI: Concentration matters! Dr. Hartman says to seek out concentrations of 10 to 20 percent of vitamin C, 10 to 15 percent for AHAs, and .05 to 2.5 percent for BHAs.)</li><li><strong>Texture:</strong> In many cases, the texture of a serum is more of a personal preference, with no one being necessarily better than another. That said, some skin types do better with certain textures — for example, oily complexions may prefer watery formulas, gels, or gel lotions to help keep skin hydrated while preventing pore congestion, says Dr. Shamban, while dry or sensitive skin may respond better to a lipid-based serum. What matters most when considering texture is whether or not you plan on layering multiple serum formulas. “A thin, milky formula tends to have a runnier consistency than a lightweight gel, so you’d want to apply the thinner formula first,” explains Dr. Hartman.&nbsp;</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questioned-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questioned, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do face serums really work?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yes, so long as you choose effective formulas and apply them properly. “The active ingredients in serums tend to be composed of smaller molecules that can be better absorbed into the skin, going deeper into the skin for maximum efficacy,” says Dr. Hartman. Then, your moisturizing creams serve as a barrier, sealing in the nutrients from your serum and adding their own benefits. Notice how we said the moisturizer seals it in? If you apply serums over moisturizer, they won’t be able to penetrate the cream and thus won’t be effective.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you apply serums on your face?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Serum should be applied consistently, AM and PM (unless otherwise noted), to achieve the best results. They should also always be applied to clean skin. “You want the best absorption so serums are most effective immediately after cleansing, before moisturizing and sunscreen (in the morning)," says Dr. Shamban.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How many serums should I use?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Less is more, says Dr. Hartman. “Most people would be fine with using one serum in the morning and another serum at night, but if you really want to use more than one, layer two serums max on your face.” You can also rotate an alternate formula in and out of your routine if your skin needs something different on a particular day. Just don’t feel the need to stack several serums into your morning and evening routines. “​​You don’t want to add so many active ingredients to your face that you risk irritation,” warns Dr. Hartman.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emily Orofino</a> is a freelance writer, editor, and consultant with over a decade of experience in the beauty industry.
