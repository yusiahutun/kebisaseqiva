<time>02 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>He’s one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL, but it’s his life off the field that has people talking. Being <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh Allen’s girlfriend</a> unfortunately comes with public interest and it’s something he’s still coming to terms with.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Buffalo Bills star</a> was selected seventh by the New York team in the 2018 NFL Draft, having played college football at the University of Wyoming where he was bowl game MVP. Famously, however, he had zero interest from FBS schools during his high school career though he was a natural athlete along with his brother Jason.</p><p>In June 2023, Allen was featured on the cover of Madden 24, the beloved NFL video game from EA Sports. “I was extremely excited,” Allen told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bleacher Report</a> on his reaction to being on the cover of Madden. “A little bit shocked. It’s such a surreal feeling. I don’t really know how to describe it. There’s only been X amount of guys who have ever graced the cover of Madden, and to be one of them and be in this small fraternity—especially the year after John Madden himself was on the cover—it’s a huge honor.”</p><p>He continued: “It’s a dream come true. As a kid playing Madden, learning all the rules and really learning football from it and having the memories of playing with my dad and brother as a young kid, it’s such a dream come true.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=josh-allen-s-girlfriends>Josh Allen’s girlfriends</h2><p>His NFL career will no doubt lead to fascination with his social life, so here’s what we know about Josh Allen’s girlfriends past and present.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=16.916007905138><h2>Hailee Steinfeld: 2023 to Present</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1495221444.jpg><p>Since May 2023, Josh Allen was rumored to be dating Hawkeye actor Hailee Steinfeld. In a series of paparazzi photographs published by TMZ in July of the same year, Allen seemingly confirmed their relationship with some steamy PDA while vacationing in Mexico.</p><p>Shortly after the photos emerged, a source told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Daily Mail</a> that things between them were getting serious. “He is really serious about her. It is so early in their relationship, but he has told friends and family that he’d like to give her a ring before winning a [Super Bowl] ring,”&nbsp;the insider said.</p><p>Their Mexican vacay was organized so they could spend some quality time together before he jumps back into NFL training for the 2023/24 season. “Josh wanted to bring Hailee on their recent Mexico vacation because he is now going to be putting so much of his focus and time on the upcoming NFL season and he just wanted to show her how much he feels about her before the next few months will take their schedules all over the place,” the source shared. “They are in the full honeymoon phase of their relationship, and he wants to make sure that they’ll be able to navigate their relationship into something special and long-lasting.”</p><p>In reaction to the photos, Allen said on the podcast Pardon My Take, explaining that he finds public interest in his love life surprising. “The fact that anybody cares about that still blows my mind,” he told the cohosts,&nbsp;Dan “Big Cat” Katz&nbsp;and&nbsp;PFT Commenter. He also said he felt violated by the invasive nature of the photographs<strong>. </strong>“I just, like, felt this gross feeling,” Allen confessed. “Insecurity. No privacy. [I was] like, ‘What is wrong with people?’”</p><p>Rumors of their relationship first started back in May 2023. In June 2023, an insider said, “Hailee and Josh have been together for about a month and it’s going really great… [They] laugh a ton when they’re together [and] are always smiling.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=14.5><h2>Brittany Williams: 2017 to 2023</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1400616163.jpg><p>Josh Allen’s last long-term relationship was with Brittany Williams. They’d known each other since they were kids and after some ups and downs during their teenage years, she invited him to a dance at her school. “He was nervous and my friends were crazy,” Williams once said on The Morning After podcast. They didn’t talk for a year after that. “He ghosted me for a year, but at the same time, I was like ‘OK I get it, things are just not in our timing right now,’ I knew it wasn’t meant to be,” she explained. The duo reconnected during their freshman year of college, when Allen texted Williams saying, “I messed up.”</p><p>At college, Williams was a cheerleader for Kappa Kappa Gamma at Fresno State and when Allen was drafted to the Buffalo Bills in 2018, she followed him to New York. “Watching your dreams come true was a moment I will never forget💙❤️ Here we come Buffalo! #BillsMafia” she wrote on Instagram at the time.</p><p>After six years together, including getting a dog, Williams and Allen broke up in 2023. They didn’t make their breakup public but sleuths noticed she’d unfollowed him and she deleted all evidence of their relationship off of social media. “Now accepting husband applications @brittwilll,” Williams’ friend Karlee Zacky wrote on an Instagram Story photo of her and Williams in May 2023.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
