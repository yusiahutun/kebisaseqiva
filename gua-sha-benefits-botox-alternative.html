Like any bride, she wanted to look stunning and radiant on her big day; exhaustion had given her dark circles, and fine lines were creeping in. But after trying Botox in her twenties, O’Brien, now 31, was hesitant about resorting to injectables—the last thing the New Yorker wanted was to look unnatural in her wedding photos.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Leading up to the wedding was absolutely crazy," she recalls. "I wanted to the glow for the photos without having a frozen-looking face from Botox."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Amidst the chaos of dress fittings, sending invitations, choosing music, and ordering the cake and flowers, O’Brien decided to try the needle-free healing treatment <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/a11234/gua-sha-treatment/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gua sha" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">gua sha</a>, a lo-fi ancient Chinese ritual that improves blood circulation, lymphatic drainage and skin elasticity, and addresses everything from adult acne to wrinkles to sagging skin. It was O’Brien’s regular visits to bespoke Manhattan salon <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://studiobritta.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Studio Britta" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Studio Britta</a>, run by the cult facialist <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/a17254/best-facialist-in-new-york/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Britta Plug" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Britta Plug</a>, that ultimately kept her calm, fixed her skin problems, and gave her that all-important bridal glow. "After seeing Britta, it all cleared up and I could still move my face; the fine lines are only there with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://theskiny.com/wrinkle-knowledge/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="dynamic movement" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">dynamic movement</a>," she says.</p><img alt="Hair, Beauty, Blond, Skin, Reflection, Shoulder, Mirror, Photography, Long hair, Photo shoot, " title="Hair, Beauty, Blond, Skin, Reflection, Shoulder, Mirror, Photography, Long hair, Photo shoot, " width=1080 height=723 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1-1556119607.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Lindsay Bilezekian</span><p>Britta Plug gives a demonstration of facial gua sha, which tones and lifts through gentle, upward strokes over the skin to relax stiff muscles and promote tissue drainage.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gua sha stems from traditional Chinese medicine. To the casual observer, it can look fairly brutal, involving vigorous scraping of the skin all over the body with an angled, blunt-edge stone. The latest incarnation of the healing treatment, however, is a much gentler form and focuses solely on the face. Using a flat rose quartz tool, or in Plug's case, a traditional Chinese bian smooth stone, facial gua sha tones and lifts the face through gentle, upward strokes over the skin to relax stiff muscles and promote tissue drainage.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite gua sha’s ancient origins, sculpting facials have become one of the hottest beauty trends in New York City over the last two years, as Western women with disposable income increasingly put a premium on promoting health and radiance from within. This new beauty fixation has seen Plug, a licensed aesthetician and holistic health coach with over 12 years of experience, expand her business into Manhattan from Brooklyn and recruit a team of nine to keep up with demand. A walking advertisement for her own treatments, many will recognize Plug—with her radiant, smooth, and soft-but-firm skin—from her YouTube videos, where she extolls the virtues of natural skincare techniques including Ayurvedic massage, as well as gua sha.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her practice, says Plug, is all about celebrating individuality, not trying to conform to some unattainable standard where you don’t look like yourself. "No judgement if you want Botox—we all care about our physical appearance—but I want women to look like the most radiant version of themselves, not a clone," Plug explains. "Gua sha is for women seeking solutions that take care of both body and mind—women who want an expression-smoothing alternative to the neurotoxins of Botox."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">First approved in 2002 for cometic use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Botox (shorthand for Botulinum Toxin Type A, a neurotoxin known for causing <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/general.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=botulism class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">botulism</a>, an illness that paralyzes muscles and can be fatal) is considered safe as a temporary solution to wrinkles. However as with any drug, there are risks; <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rxlist.com/botox-drug/patient-images-side-effects.htm#whatis data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="possible side effects" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">possible side effects</a> from Botox injections range from drooping eyelids and uneven eyebrows, to fatigue and double vision, to difficulty speaking and swallowing. Of the more than 1.1 billion people who used Botox in 2002, the FDA looked at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16112345 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="1,437 reports" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">1,437 reports</a> of adverse reactions and found that patients were more likely (33-fold higher) to report an adverse reaction after using Botox for therapeutic, rather than cosmetic use, "which may be related to higher doses, complicated underlying diseases, or both," the report concluded. In 2009, the FDA <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/ucm174949.htm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="added a safety warning" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">added a safety warning</a> which states Botox "may spread from the area of injection to produce symptoms of botulism," including muscle weakness and difficulty breathing, which can occur hours or weeks after an injection.</p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Shop the Best Gua Sha Tools<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For some women, a greater cause for concern in the lack of studies that focus on the long-term effects of Botox. One study published <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15645481 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="in 2005" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">in 2005</a>, which looked at 45 participants using Botox for both therapeutic and cosmetic reasons over the course of 12 years, found 30 percent of participants developed adverse reactions. A <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25613637 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2015 review" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">2015 review</a> of that study found the risk of adverse reactions increases after the 10th injection. There is also concern around how Botox affects the immune system. On a recent episode of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thepaleomom.com/podcast-must-know-botox-info/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Paleo View" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Paleo View</a> podcast, medical biophysicist <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thepaleomom.com/podcast-must-know-botox-info/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr. Sarah Ballantyne" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dr. Sarah Ballantyne</a>, PhD, notes that Botox can travel through the central nervous system and stimulate an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25853816 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="inflammatory response" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">inflammatory response</a> in the immune system, which is the likely culprit of adverse reactions. "As I was researching this, I was very frustrated by the lack of long-term studies looking at whether or not the risk of adverse reactions compounds over time," she explains. "I would have thought that would be necessary for FDA approval, but obviously it wasn’t."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When migraine and TMJ sufferer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://drkananind.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr. Nikka Kanani" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dr. Nikka Kanani</a> started getting Botox injections for pain relief, she suffered nausea, numbness and tingling in certain areas of her face. "I never felt fully comfortable relying on Botox, especially because research on its long-term use is lacking," admits the naturopathic doctor, who eventually stopped using the injectable neurotoxin, and with her background in integrative medicine, was relieved to find the natural gua sha treatments. By watching Plug’s video tutorials, Dr. Kanani has been able to practice the massage at home daily and stresses that consistency has helped her achieve the pain relief she was hoping for.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Similarly, Arielle Hayat, a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.arielletheherbalist.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="clinical herbalist" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">clinical herbalist</a> at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thealchemistskitchen.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Alchemist's Kitchen," data-vars-ga-product-id=192a1486-9025-4307-ab9b-329c68d3f6f9 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.thealchemistskitchen.com/ data-product-url=https://www.thealchemistskitchen.com/ data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=16912aad-f997-41d9-9ee4-aef0547d371b class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">The Alchemist's Kitchen,</a> has had tangible results since switching from Botox to gua sha nine months ago.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hayat received regular Botox treatments twice a year for five years—and was cautiously optimistic before starting gua sha. While her fine lines haven’t disappeared completely, the deeper lines are less noticeable. "Right over the eyebrow, where you get a little line, a crease, those have softened," she explains. "People tell me all the time, 'You're glowing, your skin is glowing! You're so bright!' It's the same compliment I used to get when I got Botox."</p><img alt="Hair, Face, Eyebrow, Blond, Lip, Hairstyle, Forehead, Beauty, Skin, Hair coloring, " title="Hair, Face, Eyebrow, Blond, Lip, Hairstyle, Forehead, Beauty, Skin, Hair coloring, " width=1080 height=1975 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ba-massage2-1558551204.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">.</span><p>Arielle Hayat, a clinical herbalist, has had tangible results since switching from Botox to gua sha nine months ago.

"My wrinkles made it look like I was constantly in a bad mood," she explains. "When I blow dry my hair, I raise my eyebrows; when I brush my teeth, I raise my eyebrows; when I put on mascara, I raise my eyebrows; and when I look at my phone, I make faces. I started to notice those faces were stuck on my face, even when they weren't expressing my emotions." Hayat now practices gua sha every day for three minutes. "That's all I really have time for and I’ve noticed such a difference, specifically over my eyebrow."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While it can take time, effort, and dedication to adopt a rigorous at-home gua sha routine, it’s essential for those wanting better, faster results, says Plug, who offers tutorials through the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://wildling.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Wildling Beauty" data-vars-ga-product-id=ebc6495c-ccfe-48d9-a0ca-9e0603890648 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://wildling.com/ data-product-url=https://wildling.com/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwildling.com%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=b427792d-f409-40f3-8d3d-80397c67117e class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Wildling Beauty</a> website and YouTube. Wildling Beauty, which Plug launched with plant alchemist Jill Munson and acupuncturist and herbalist Gianna De La Torre, aims to help women access the benefits of gua sha at home.

"Many clients are women working their butts off in major careers with families, and who are experiencing rapid aging and adult acne," Plug says.

I just want to look the best I can, and within a year I’ve definitely seen a reduction in the wrinkle."</p><img alt="Face, Hair, Eyebrow, Lip, Skin, Nose, Forehead, Head, Beauty, Selfie, " title="Face, Hair, Eyebrow, Lip, Skin, Nose, Forehead, Head, Beauty, Selfie, " width=1080 height=2200 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ba-massage-1558551243.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">.</span><p>Within a year of starting monthly gua sha facials, 46-year-old Amy Abrams was delighted that a stubborn frown line faded considerably.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another client, Allison Jacobs, who uses Botox occasionally, says gua sha is wonderful for women who prefer natural treatments, but she stresses the importance of committing to regular sessions. "It can soften lines if you do it every day," she says. "It’s great facial stimulation."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">These days, bespoke, holistic services are not only the domain of small, independent specialists such as Britta Plug. With five shops in New York and two in California, skincare chain <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.heydayskincare.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Heyday data-vars-ga-product-id=a7a4df5f-38b3-49be-b05f-787bbb8ad3f4 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.heydayskincare.com/ data-product-url=https://www.heydayskincare.com/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.heydayskincare.com%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=5e51784c-c530-40b1-864a-99cbd1451a52 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Heyday</a> offers a range of personalized facials (including a hemp-derived CBD service in Los Angeles) and has a philosophy of being progressive, not aggressive, with its products and treatments.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Heyday chief brand officer and co-founder Michael Pollak believes the industry is trending in the right direction, with customers demanding more transparency and integrity around words such as "natural" and "organic". He says skincare experiences in 2019 are about much more than mere pampering. "When we started Heyday, we expressly chose not to use the word 'spa' to describe ourselves, or 'pampering' to talk about facials. We have nothing against spas and fully believe you'll feel pampered and cared for in a facial. But what you’re truly receiving is time with an expert for their advice and their human touch."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As for the holistic approach, Pollak points out that the skin, being our largest organ, is inextricably tied to whole-body health. While they can get excellent work done in a facial, it’s what happens between facials—diet, exercise, stress, environment—that affects our skin.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">His words are echoed by Dr. Jessica Weiser from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nydermatologygroup.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="New York Dermatology Group" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">New York Dermatology Group</a>, who says proper skin care involves many steps. Dr. Weiser explains that the trend towards ancient Eastern skincare routines, such as gua sha and Ayurveda, reflects a growing interest in more natural lifestyles and can certainly assist with skin vibrancy and clarity. "These routines encourage the elimination of chemicals from the body and the skin specifically," notes Dr. Weiser, who encourages all her patients to take care of their skin between facial treatments. "The treatments require frequent repetition and can help contribute to a comprehensive skin routine."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Marina Helms, who follows Plug's skincare tips on Instagram, echoes this sentiment. Based in Brazil, Helms began practicing gua sha five times a week after discovering Plug’s online tutorials. And while it took several weeks to notice a difference on fine lines, she says the results on puffiness and tension were instant. “It has opened up my eyes, defined my jaw line, and helped on skin quality," says Helms, adding that "the real results come from taking care and loving my skin consistently at home."</p><img alt="Text, Font, Line, " title="Text, Font, Line, " width=1080 height=450 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/botox-quote-1558625389.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">.</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Last year, 27-year-old Helms ditched her dermatologist’s advice to use Botox to lift her eyebrows and stop wrinkles. “The feeling of not moving your face was the worst for me, it made me feel weird. I felt trapped in some way; the blockage in my face made me feel like my energy couldn’t flow there," she explains. Despite the popularity of Botox, which Helms first tired at 23, she soon realized that it was a shame to freeze her own expressions of happiness, sadness, or any feelings just to be ‘pretty’ in a picture. "Then my friends and family started telling me that I didn’t look like myself anymore; my cheeks were in a different place," she laughs. "Now, I still get to move my face and have natural expression lines."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Plug says she is concerned about young women who start injections early. "I strongly suspect we’ll be seeing more research on how long-term use of an injected neurotoxin affects the nervous system and brain in unintended way," she warns.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite having tried Botox in her twenties, Danielle O’Brien is adamant she won’t be tempted to do injections again. Since her wedding last September, she has continued to visit Plug regularly to help rejuvenate her skin and promote overall health.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I love that you go into a meditative state which helps with healing," she says. "It's a place for me to calm down and not be on my phone. It fixes the big circles under my eyes, de-puffs my skin, and I can still move my face!”</p><img alt="Footwear, Shoe, Design, Black-and-white, Pattern, " title="Footwear, Shoe, Design, Black-and-white, Pattern, " width=1080 height=320 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bumper-1556120634.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Ingrid Frahm</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/20dacdfd-513f-4775-bf26-190cb0245afd_1539704064.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Prue Lewington" title="Headshot of Prue Lewington" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Prue Lewington began her career 20 years ago in New York at Harper's Bazaar.&nbsp;</p><p>From there she joined fashion maven Patricia Field to assist the wardrobe team on HBO’s hit TV series, Sex and the City.</p><p>In 2002, she returned to print, working with US publications including Nylon Magazine, In Style, The New York Daily News and The New York Post, where she wrote a weekly column on emerging trends.&nbsp; In 2010, she was appointed fashion editor at The Sunday Telegraph.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqyjmaN6pK3Rnmaaamdnf3qDkGtmoK2RYsCprYybnKedlp7BtHnBqKuosF2WubWx0aeYraGmmnw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgua-sha-benefits-botox-alternative.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgua-sha-benefits-botox-alternative.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgua-sha-benefits-botox-alternative.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgua-sha-benefits-botox-alternative.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgua-sha-benefits-botox-alternative.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgua-sha-benefits-botox-alternative.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./little-boy-four-born-without-spine-defies-odds-walk-own-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./little-boy-four-born-without-spine-defies-odds-walk-own-html.html>Jett McNamara born without part of his spine defies the odds to walk on his own</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./5d1ef53022601dec758b45d7-html.html>Cae un histrico: el Palermo de Luca Toni, Cavani o Dybala desaparece</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./5d1ef53022601dec758b45d7-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
