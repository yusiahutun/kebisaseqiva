Running for over four decades, it captivated audiences with its intricate storylines, compelling characters, and talented cast.</p><p>One Life to Live was a beloved American soap opera that aired on the ABC network from 1968, to 2013. Created by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Agnes Nixon</a>, the show was known for its innovative storytelling and progressive themes, tackling issues such as racism, social class, and LGBTQ+ representation.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Set in the fictional town of Llanview, Pennsylvania, One Life to Live revolved around the lives, loves, and scandals of the diverse residents of the fictional town. From the wealthy Lords to the working-class Buchanans, the show depicted the intertwining lives of its characters with drama, romance, and suspense.</p><p>Several actors performed on&nbsp;the One Life to Live cast&nbsp;for 20 years or more including&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Erika Slezak</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Storm</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert S.

Let’s refresh your memory. Cross, as Kate Sanders, was marrying the man of her dreams, Cord Roberts, when his “dead” wife busted in on the ceremony to announce she was alive&nbsp;and&nbsp;pregnant with his baby. And yes, this is why we love soaps—it’s all about the plot twists.
