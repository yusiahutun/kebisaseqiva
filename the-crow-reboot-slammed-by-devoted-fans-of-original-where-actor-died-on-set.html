<time>20 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>The chilling first photos of The Crow reboot have dropped, but fans are still uneasy over the film being remade 20 years later after actor Brandon Lee died on set</strong>.</p><p>The first-look images of the noir thriller were released on Wednesday, February 28, but some <a href=#>movie</a> fans aren’t happy it’s coming back at all. <a href=#>Hollywood</a> director Rupert Sanders has come out to say Brandon Lee was “an original voice” with the film, and will always “be synonymous with The Crow”, even though the reboot is set to make a comeback. Brandon, son of marital arts icon Bruce Lee, tragically died after he was accidentally shot and killed by a jammed prop gun on the 1994 film set. Some fans don’t want the flick to come out at all.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-i-hope-he-s-proud-of-what-we-ve-done>‘I hope he’s proud of what we’ve done’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-77344834-668x1024.jpg><p>Speaking <a href=# rel=nofollow>to</a> Variety, Sanders has come out to say his presence is still in The Crow reboot.</p><p>He said: “I hope he’s proud of what we’ve done and how we’ve brought the story back again.”</p><p>Speaking earlier this week, Sanders added: “His soul is very much alive in this film,” Sanders said of Lee this week.</p><p>Lee was cast as the role of vengeful Eric Draven in the original movie, which was directed by Alex Proyas, based on the comic book series by James O’Barr. However, in March 1993, the 28-year-old <a href=#>celebrity</a> sadly died after something on set went terribly wrong.</p><p>It also left the same tragic atmosphere after his <a href=#>father’s death, Bruce Lee</a>.</p><p>In The Crow reboot we see Bill Skarsgård and FKA Twigs take on the story, with some of the chilling makeup a link to Lee’s portrayal of the character. Twigs plays Draven’s love interest, Shelly.</p><p>The 1994 edition has become a cult classic, with many fans flocking to watch it after finding out what happened behind the scenes. But the new release will be a modern take on the plot.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-skarsgard-is-the-right-man-for-the-crow-reboot>Skarsgård is the ‘right man for The Crow reboot’</h2><p>Sanders believes Skarsgård’s adaptation of Pennywise the Clown in the ‘It’ movie, was a decent grounding for the actor.</p><p>But he’s aware the feelings fans will have with Brandon Lee’s death in the original.</p><p>The Snow White and the Huntsman director said: “Obviously, it was a terrible tragedy,” adding “it’s definitely something that we’ve always had in mind through the making of the film.”</p><p>Calling Lee’s take on the character as possessing “fragility and beauty”, he believes The Crow reboot “feels like he is a successor to that”.</p><p>The synopsis reads: “Given the chance to save his true love by sacrificing himself, Eric sets out to seek merciless revenge on their killers, traversing the worlds of the living and the dead to put the wrong things right.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-aren-t-looking-forward-to-it>Fans aren’t looking forward to it</h2><p>Hardcore fans aren’t happy it’s getting remade, and took their thoughts to Twitter after seeing the new photos.</p><p>One wrote: “This sums up Gen Z… their Eric Draven is Bill Skarsblah… while mine had Brandon Lee. There is no comparison! Brandon is turning in his grave.”</p><p>A second added: “Well, regardless of how you feel about reboots, if you haven’t watched The Crow in a minute, it still holds up. Brandon Lee is perfect and stupidly handsome. If we are honest, Burn is a top three song by The Cure.”</p><p>And a third echoed: “I actually need to rewatch the crow now. No man and i mean absolutely NO MAN EVER has looked as good on screen as Brandon Lee did in that movie. No one has ever touched this face card like it’s truly serious”</p><p>While a fourth penned: “I am not going to but The Crow shouldn’t have a remake in my opinion because no one can play Eric Draven as good as Brandon lee like yeah no disrespect to Bill Skarsgard because he was awesome as Pennywise but The Crow should be a memory for Brandon lee and left alone.”</p><p>The Crow reboot is set to premiere in theaters on June 7.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2eGcMDHnmScqp%2BserOxwaimrWWjoa6uucSdZJuxXZmyt7vTnptmnpGjwG67xWamq6GXnruiuIywn56qlWKupMDOq2SdoZWZerC6jKycrWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-crow-reboot-slammed-by-devoted-fans-of-original-where-actor-died-on-set.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-crow-reboot-slammed-by-devoted-fans-of-original-where-actor-died-on-set.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-crow-reboot-slammed-by-devoted-fans-of-original-where-actor-died-on-set.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-crow-reboot-slammed-by-devoted-fans-of-original-where-actor-died-on-set.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-crow-reboot-slammed-by-devoted-fans-of-original-where-actor-died-on-set.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-crow-reboot-slammed-by-devoted-fans-of-original-where-actor-died-on-set.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mark-stepnoski.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mark-stepnoski.html>Who is Mark Stepnoski dating?
