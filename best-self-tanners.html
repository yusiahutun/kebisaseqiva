Base tans are BS and using a low SPF to “protect” your skin while you tan is nearly as bad as not using one at all. That’s not to say you can’t have skin that looks sun-kissed, though. All you need is a trusty self tanner on rotation in your beauty routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s a self-tanning format for everyone, from newbies and self-tanning pros to acne-prone and mature skin. The only challenging part is finding the right match —&nbsp;there is a mind-boggling amount of self tanners on the market today. That’s where we come in. We tapped 30 beauty pros to test 42 different faux glow formulas over the course of two weeks, judging them on how they applied, whether or not they transferred, how they felt, how long they last, and their results overall. From there, we narrowed down the list to the 20 best self tanners.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-st-tropez-self-tan-classic-bronzing-mousse></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>St. Tropez Self Tan Classic Bronzing Mousse</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="St. Tropez Self Tan Classic Bronzing Mousse" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PSXSOhDqXhErz1l8RRxw7-NANOI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/st-tropez-self-tan-classic-bronzing-mousse-6123a85448ac4e2cb5db1fd0e4cf999d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Tan Longevity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Results</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The lightweight mousse applies evenly and dries quickly.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>This may not work well on all skin tones due to the green undertone of the formula.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even for a self-tanning rookie like us, we had no issues achieving a glorious tan with this iconic product. With the help of a mitt, the whipped texture helped the formula spread easily across the body, even in the tricky-to-reach spots (like our back). It features a guide color, which made it a breeze to ensure we’d gotten even coverage and not missed any areas. Once we finished applying, the formula didn’t feel tacky at all, and dried rapidly—to the point that even when we accidentally put on (and quickly removed) a sports bra, our tan’s development was not disrupted. It didn’t stain our clothing or our sheets, and the scent was unobtrusive, so we didn’t mind sitting around for the suggested eight hours to let the tan develop.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The color began to show within four hours of application, which was a huge plus—we tend to apply a second coat if our tan takes too long to appear, which has caused us to overdo it with the glow in the past. We showered after eight hours, and loved the radiant glow left behind (it garnered us plenty of compliments, too). The tan looked its best at the two to three-day mark, but it was still noticeable after five days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only caveat to using this product is that it works best on cooler skin tones, regardless of how fair or deep your complexion is as the formula features green undertones, which looks best on cooler complexions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Color Range: </strong>1<strong>｜Type: </strong>Mousse<strong>｜Development Time: </strong>4-8 hours<strong>｜Size: </strong>8 fl.

While other formulas we’ve tested in the past left our reddish skin looking orange, this one gave our skin a fresh glow that developed almost instantly after we applied it. Within just 24 hours, we got two compliments, with friends telling us we looked so summery, which was exactly what we wanted from this product. It also gave us an impressively durable tan—it lasted for around four or five days, even with twice-daily showers (once in the morning, once after working out).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While most self-tanning face mists are applied by spraying them on, this one is meant to be spritzed onto a cotton pad and then swiped across the face, reserving direct spritzing for the neck and decollete. While this is a bit inconvenient, it was ultimately pretty helpful—the formula features a guide color that made it easy to see where we’d applied it. Just don’t forget to apply it to your ears! We missed this area the first time, and it was pretty noticeable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Color Range: </strong>1<strong>｜Type: </strong>Mist<strong>｜Development Time: </strong>n/a<strong>｜Size: </strong>3 fl.

The natural-looking tan was flattering (and non-intimidating) with just one application, though it was clear that the formula could be layered for a deeper glow. It had a pleasant floral scent that seasoned self-tanner aficionados confirmed was nicer than those of other formulas they tried. Once the tan fully developed, it lasted for five days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we do love that this formula instantly gives us a glow, it’s worth noting that it didn’t dry very rapidly—it took up to 30 minutes to fully set. However, once it did dry, it didn’t transfer at all, so keep that in mind if you plan on applying this formula before an evening out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Color Range: </strong>2<strong>｜Type: </strong>Mousse<strong>｜Development Time: </strong>Instantly and over time<strong>｜Size: </strong>5 fl. ounces</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-8 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="A person's arm after applying Sol by Jergens No Wait Tropical Tan" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XeX_nDLULeH1lrEb3O8VKSgVQUc=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-self-tanners-test-sol-jergens-wait-tropical-chelsea-dinterman-02-1-1-3ae71cf9d01042bcbe1ecfed2b5bf66a.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Chelsea Dinterman</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="A person's arm before applying Sol by Jergens No Wait Tropical Tan" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MrPo0BEToHCpZr-4PljYQCf35aY=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-self-tanners-test-sol-jergens-wait-tropical-chelsea-dinterman-01-1-1-a83921daefb14fd5b160632fc9d013b5.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Chelsea Dinterman</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-mature-skin-coco--eve-sunny-honey-bali-bronzing-foam></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Mature Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Coco & Eve Sunny Honey Bali Bronzing Foam</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Coco &amp;amp; Eve Sunny Honey Bali Bronzing Foam" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7EzsjRCiIP6_0ANlaGEnIb_TRDc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Coco--Eve-Sunny-Honey-Bali-Bronzing-Foam-06c1d552d5f34d4690eba8d7948c6f0e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Coco & Eve</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Tan Longevity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Results</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This self-tanner was very long-lasting—we got six days of wear out of one application.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>This formula may transfer to your sheets, especially if you go to sleep right after application.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This genius formula is fantastic for bronzing skin and making it look toned, subtly tightening skin, and smoothing the look of cellulite. Even though we showered four times within the six days our tan lasted, it never faded patchily and looked quite realistic on our fair skin—like we’d spent a few days in the sun, not like a spray tan or fake tan at all. The formula went on easily and we found its scent pleasant, with light tropical fruit notes that helped mask the traditional self tanner smell.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We will note that on some areas of our body (face and chest), the bronzing foam left our skin feeling tacky, while others (legs and arms) dried completely. We noticed that there was some <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>color transfer to our sheets</a> and the clothing we wore post-tan, but it washed out easily and we didn’t experience any transfer or staining in the subsequent days of wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Color Range: </strong>3<strong>｜Type: </strong>Mousse<strong>｜Development Time: </strong>2 hours<strong>｜Size: </strong>6.7 fl. ounces</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-instant-results-bondi-sands-pure-self-tanning-drops></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Instant Results</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bondi Sands Pure Self Tanning Drops</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bondi Sands Pure Self Tanning Drops" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/iuV88SpkXsxm9pvUwBF3PTgNz_Q=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bondi-sands-pure-self-tanning-drops-113215310eb1491a94a9af4c7c55a625.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Tan Longevity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Results</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This formula develops quickly and is shockingly easy to use.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You may have to experiment with the number of drops you use to get your desired color.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking to get a glow quickly without a fuss, this Bondi Sands formula is a must-try. You use it by simply mixing 4-12 drops into your favorite moisturizer and applying it as you usually would. We got great results by blending six drops into our go-to face cream and massaging it using circular motions to ensure thorough coverage. We noticed no fragrance, only the scent of our moisturizer, and it gave us a very natural glow that our tester’s husband noticed the same day. We found that the glow faded within three days if we didn’t reapply, but following the same protocol (six drops in our moisturizer) on a daily basis maintained our tan flawlessly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Remember, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>drop-type self tanner </a>allows you to completely customize your tan.

The mousse formula went on easily and smoothly, gliding across skin without skipping or creating streaks. Though it felt somewhat sticky as it dried, it didn’t transfer unless our skin made extended contact with whatever we touched.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because this is an express formula, we showered two hours after application to reveal our tan, which was very deep. If you have very fair skin, the color of this tan may be startling at first. However, while the color is darker, it’s never orange, but may be better suited for deeper skin tones. It looks even better after the first two days and looks natural and even as it wears off.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Color Range: </strong>3<strong>｜Type: </strong>Mousse<strong>｜Development Time: </strong>2 hours<strong>｜Size: </strong>6.7 fl. ounces</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-mist-st-tropez-self-tan-purity-face-mist></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Mist</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>St. Tropez Self Tan Purity Face Mist</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="St. Tropez Self Tan Purity Face Mist" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/a-a-X5i3coJN7I4NscldSj5aEXA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sttropez-self-tan-purity-face-mist-80ml--68d97ca227bf47598428f580f9f29fdb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>St. Tropez</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Tan Longevity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Results</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This left our face feeling moisturized with a subtle, pretty radiance.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You won’t be able to tell where you spritzed on the formula—trust the process!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Face tan is a newer self-tanner format, and after trying this formula from St. Tropez, we’re hooked. We spritzed it in across our face, neck, and chest, following the brand’s instructions of using about seven pumps, then just let it sit—there’s no need to rub it in or even rinse it off. It didn’t dry fully, which we actually loved. It didn’t leave our skin feeling sticky, just gently moisturized, with a light tropical scent that didn’t linger. After four hours, we saw a beautiful, delicate glow that made our skin look healthy, though not necessarily tan, that we looked forward to achieving day after day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because this formula is clear and mists on instead of being rubbed in, it can be a bit nerve-wracking to apply, even if you’re a self-tanner newbie. Don’t overthink it—just go for it and spray it on liberally. Though it seems like it would go on blotchy, it doesn’t, and it creates such light color that you won’t ever feel overdone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Color Range: </strong>1<strong>｜Type: </strong>Mist<strong>｜Development Time: </strong>4-8 hours<strong>｜Size: </strong>2.7 fl. ounces</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drops-isle-of-paradise-medium-self-tanning-firming-body-drops></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drops</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Isle of Paradise Self-Tanning Firming Body Drops</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Isle of Paradise Medium Self-Tanning Firming Body Drops" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/aUIwqyjWp-Y6S9bSVd3tPbAGPQ8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/isle-of-paradise-self-tanning-firming-body-drops-e06a852fa0ce482b85768f3bcbb6a991.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Tan Longevity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Results</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.6</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This product can be mixed into any of your favorite body lotions and doesn’t have to be rinsed off.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish the formula had a color.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This serum-like formula is very straightforward and easy to use: We just mixed it into our favorite coconut-scented <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>body butter</a>, applied it all over our body, then washed our hands to make sure the tanner didn’t stain our palms. While we’ve experienced streakiness with other tanning drops, we found this formula went on smoothly and evenly, and didn’t transfer to our sheets at all. Usually, we sleep in sweatpants and long sleeves after self-tanning, but this formula absorbed easily with our body cream, leaving our white sheets bright and clean. We woke up to beautiful, sun-kissed skin, and our glow lasted for about four days, even though we worked out and showered daily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, we loved the formula and plan on purchasing a new bottle after we use up this one (and recommended it to our friends!), but we do wish that it wasn’t clear.

After applying our bronzing cocktail, we went to bed and woke up with a glow that was subtle and even.

While some self tanners are sold solo and you’re forced to find your own application tools, this Il Makiage product came with two—a body mitt and a kabuki brush—that made it a breeze to flawlessly apply the smooth, spreadable foam and buff it into our skin for a seamless finish.

A few drops blended beautifully into our moisturizer, making it easy to apply, and didn’t leave our palms stained afterwards. We got two days of wear out of each application and delivered a true tan that caused us to switch to our summer shades of foundation and concealer.

The featherlight foam went on easily and dried within five minutes (with no sticky sensation), after which we went to bed and woke up with bronzed skin and completely clean sheets. We loved how there was zero odor; our friends know we’re loyal to self tanner and asked if we were wearing any because they couldn’t smell anything at all.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately, we didn’t get a long wear time out of this formula, though we weren’t bothered by this. Our dry, pale skin tends to eat up self tanner quickly, and we’re used to applying it on the regular. We also noticed some patchiness as the tan faded, but we chalked that up to not being consistent with our moisturizing routine.

Though there’s no guide color, the damp sensation of the towelette made it simple to tell where we’d previously swiped, so we barely experienced any streaking. They’re completely mess-free—zero dripping, residue, or transfer—making them ideal for travel, and because they offer a subtle, gradual glow, they’re ideal for helping fair complexions build up their bronze.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The towelettes are generously sized, but they could be a little bigger as we needed two of them to cover our entire body.

Despite the feel of the formula, it was easy to wash off of our hands, and because it was clear, it didn’t transfer onto our sheets. After seven hours, we rinsed off, and could see a great glow. Usually, we apply self tanner twice in two days to achieve our preferred level of bronze, but we only needed to use this once to see a satisfying glow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we loved the formula, we needed to adjust to its unusual texture at first—we accidentally applied too much at first and those areas took much longer to dry as a result.

We love how the formula felt similar to a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hyaluronic acid</a>-based gel moisturizer—we used about a nickel-sized amount, which spread easily to cover our face and neck. It absorbed in 30 seconds to leave our skin feeling soft but not greasy, and sat well under makeup with zero tacky texture. About three hours after we put it on, we noticed our complexion had deepened by a shade. If we’d wanted, we could have applied three layers to achieve a bolder glow, but as we have fair skin, we were happy with the subtler bronze.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-110 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We used this on our face, but it could also be used on our bodies if we wanted. We ended up going to Dior’s website to look for more guidance on how to use the formula, but there was no information beyond the suggestion of layering more coats for a deeper tan. This may be a bit nerve-wracking if you’re new to self tanner, but seasoned pros will have no fear diving in and experimenting with this product.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-111 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Color Range: </strong>1<strong>｜Type: </strong>Gel<strong>｜Development Time: </strong>n/a<strong>｜Size: </strong>1.7 fl. ounces</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-45 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="A person holds Dior Solar The Self-Tanning Gel in their palm" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lQ_rXZOOtg6Z8t5E3XrZDBRm0-k=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-self-tanners-test-dior-solar-gel-allison-vancura-03-1-1-142122c0c1934722908fd30eca6cbad0.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Allison Vancura</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="A person before applying Dior Solar The Self-Tanning Gel" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/j5ltKsrOG8QZlDFOQ7MziVFdddI=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-self-tanners-test-dior-solar-gel-allison-vancura-01-1-1-2f06e786cf2043cdb3d298576dcc9233.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Allison Vancura</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-oil-typology-self-tanning-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Oil</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Typology Self-Tanning Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Typology Self-Tanning Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8dW2vqYgvbIpcmPkXXkvJBafch8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/typology-6c444e564b794c4289d7a324a55e78a9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Typology</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Tan Longevity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Results</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>A little goes a long way and feels wonderful on the skin.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The color transferred to our towels.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-115 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This silky formula is rich in buriti oil, so it went on luxuriously, but never felt greasy at all.

They even examined their pillowcases, sheets, clothing, and towels to see if the tan transferred or stained. They rated each self-tanner on a scale of one to five (five being the highest) and added comments about each step of the process. We averaged the scores and from there narrowed those 42 picks to the 20 best formulas. We wrote about the positives and negatives of each formula as well as any testers’ notes from the testing.

They’re prevalent for a reason—they’re great for beginners and easy to use, though it may not seem like it at first. “They’re fast-absorbing and provide fast results,” says Hall. “Most tanning mousses also contain an instant bronzer which allows the user to see exactly where they have applied the product.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You’ll also find lotions and gels, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Dior Solar The Self-Tanning Gel</a>. “These are my personal favorite because not only do they help achieve a fake tan, but they also moisturize the skin, and it can be hard to find deeply moisturizing properties in a mousse,” says Vitello.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have oily skin, you’ll love a mist or water like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">L'Oreal Sublime Bronze Self-Tanning Water Mist</a>. because they’re oil-free and won’t block your pores. “Those with oilier skin will want to choose a non-comedogenic product and are often happiest with mousse and mist type applications as these dry quickly and blend into the natural oils on your skin,” agrees Dr. Galaria.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Drops and serums are popular, but while they sound identical, they’re quite different.

I don’t recommend drops for people new to self tanning because it can be hard to understand how much product you’re actually using and you could wake up to a nightmare—orange hands and possibly an overly tan face.” Try <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Lux Unfiltered N°12 Bronzing Face Drops</a>, which delivers great color without being too intense.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lastly, there are self tanning wipes, which is one of the rarest formats. “Wipes are often a less messy application method and I recommend them to my patients for travel,” says Dr. Galaria.

It’s typically derived from sugarcane or sugar beets. “When it is applied to the skin, a chemical reaction occurs with the amino acids in the top layer of your skin, producing a brown pigment called melanoidin,” says Dr. Galaria. This reaction is known as the Maillard reaction. If you’re a home chef, you may be familiar with the term—it’s what happens to create crusts on baked goods or seared steaks. “In the case of our skin, this reaction is occurring with the stratum corneum or top-most, dead layer of our skin,” Dr. Galaria says. Because it doesn’t penetrate more deeply than that, self tanner won’t permanently affect the color of your skin. In addition to this, most formulas contain a cosmetic bronzer, or guide color. “This creates an immediate bronzed glow that rinses away to reveal your new beautiful, natural self-tan,” says Montgomery.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For the longest time, self tanner only came in one color, which didn’t flatter all skin tones and caused some complexions to look orange in hue. Luckily, in recent years, self tanning formulas have evolved significantly and come in different colors. Some brands even offer shade ranges in some of their formulas, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Tanologist Self Tan Mousse</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Tan-Luxe The Face Illuminating Self-Tan Drops</a>. Before committing, though, you’ll want to know the undertone of both the product and your skin. “The most common undertones in sunless products are typically olive and violet,” says Vitello. We know this sounds a little complicated and very different from what you’re used to with makeup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It may surprise you, but if you have a cool undertone, you’ll want to go for a formula with olive undertones, like you’ll find in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">St. Tropez Self Tan Classic Bronzing Mousse</a>. “It will develop into a nice warm-toned tan that might be hard for you to achieve in the sun without burning and also neutralize any apparent redness,” says Vitello. Those with warmer complexions should check out a product with a violet undertone, such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">b.Tan Glow Your Own Way Tan Gel</a>. “A self tanner with a violet undertone will color correct any yellowness in your skin while also creating a deeper faux glow that compliments your natural olive undertones,” Vitello explains. Do you have a neutral undertone? You can try either! Violet will give you more of a deeper tan while olive will read as a sunkissed glow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You may be tempted to mix and match formulas, but aside from using different formulas on the face and body, this isn’t recommended as you could create very inconsistent color across your body. Instead, apply multiple layers in some areas, like the stomach and legs, and one very light coat on your hands and feet to get a perfect tan. “Using self tanning mousse with a stippling brush along areas you usually contour has also become so popular!” adds Vitello.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Development Time</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are three types of self tanner—gradual, traditional, and express. These speak to the development time as well as the concentration of the DHA in the product. “DHA will continue to react and create a tanned effect over a period of time, sometimes up to 24 hours after application,” explains Hall. “This is why it is so important to wash your hands after applying a face tan, or shower off your tan in the timeframe advised on the specific product you are applying — to avoid over developing or staining the skin.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Gradual tanners are very mild, requiring regular application (sometimes daily) to achieve a deeper glow. “This makes them great for first-time self tanners, or people with very fair skin tones that want to be able to build their color on their own terms,” says Vitello. Traditional formulas make up the bulk of self tanners, with a mid-level percentage of DHA and usually a cosmetic bronzer to give you both instant gratification and a sense of where you’ve applied it. These formulas, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Il Makiage 85/66 Magic Moisturizing Sun Foam</a>, are typically recommended to be rinsed off at around the six hour mark or longer, making them ideal for when you have time to spare or like to tan overnight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Express tans are exactly what they sound like—fast.

The most important prep step is exfoliating. “Remember that depending on the body area, there are 15 or more layers of stratum corneum,” says Dr. Galaria. “If you can remove the top most layer—the one that was going to shed off the soonest—by exfoliating before you apply your product, you will have applied it to a layer of skin that is going to ‘stick around’ longer, thus prolonging the life of your fake tan.” She recommends concentrating on drier areas of the body like elbows, knees, ankles, and feet; dry skin tends to absorb self tanner more noticeably, which will create noticeably darker areas. “I also tell patients to shave before tanning because this also removes a layer of skin, so if you do it after tanning, you can look splotchy,” she adds. Vitello recommends doing all of this around 24 hours before you plan to tan.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once you’re prepped, strip down, ensure your skin is clean and fully dry, and stand somewhere that’s easy to clean, just in case (we often self-tan in our showers with the water turned off, or standing on a bathmat or old towel). How you apply your tanner will depend on the type of product you’re using. If it’s a mousse (the most common format), make sure you have a tanning mitt. Vitello also likes disposable nitrile gloves. “Using gloves saves you tons of product because the solution can’t absorb into them like a mitt,” she shares.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Start applying your product from the bottom of your body, spreading the formula on and blending it in using firm circular motions, working your way up until you’ve covered your whole body. We know getting your back can be tricky, so consider asking your partner or a pal to help. “If you don’t have a friend to help you, purchase a self tanning applicator made to reach your back,” says Vitello.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For your face, neck, hands, and feet, consider using a dense makeup brush, like a kabuki, to buff in the formula. This will help you get into the nooks and crannies (like between your knuckles, around your ears, and into your hairline) without the product building up, which creates patchiness.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can I use the same tanning products for both my face and body?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You can, but our experts generally recommend using separate products for each. Montgomery points out that some body products could cause pore congestion if used on the face, especially if it contains a cosmetic bronzer (like a guide color), says Vitello, who recommends using a clear formula like a serum or water instead. Additionally, the skin on your face is thinner, so it can develop twice as dark as your body if you’re not careful,” warns Vitello.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How long does self tanner usually last?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On average, you can expect a self tan to last anywhere from five to 10 days. That’ll vary, though—the durability of your tan directly correlates to how well you prepped your skin before applying your formula of choice and how you care for it after it’s developed, as well as your skin type and everyday lifestyle. Montgomery shares that the most important factor in maintaining your tan is keeping your skin hydrated.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Before using any old formula in your skincare routine, make sure it’s compatible with self tanner. Vitello recommends immediately discontinuing body washes that contain parabens, sulfates, alcohol, and even oils, though they may be nourishing, they will break down your tan. “Choose a gel-like body wash over products that are intensely moisturizing and creamy,” she says. She tells all of her clients to use <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Native Body Wash</a> when they’re wearing fake tan. She also recommends using a clean and straightforward body lotion like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Cetaphil</a> to moisturize after every shower.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To really go the extra mile, Hall advises against excessively sweating, showering using overly hot water, or spending too much time in pools or at the beach. “Unfortunately, all of these fun things will contribute to your tan fading off your skin,” she says. But that’s not to say those who are devoted to a fitness routine can’t maintain a ta —you’ll just have to shower immediately after your workout. “The longer sweat stays on top of your fake tan, the more likely it is to begin drying it and cause patchiness or uneven fading,” warns Vitello, so rinse off right away using cool water. And remember to maintain your regular exfoliation routine. This will help the layer of skin holding the tanner shed evenly, which will help you further avoid patchiness.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can I use self tanner if I’m pregnant or nursing?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For the most part, moms-to-be and new mamas can safely use self tanner. “Since these products are not believed to soak in past the dead layers of your skin, they are considered safe in pregnancy and breastfeeding,” confirms Dr. Galaria. That said, you’ll want to check with your doctor to be certain. “They might recommend you wait until after your first trimester, which is what I usually recommend to my pregnant spray tan clients, or stick to a product with a lower percentage of DHA,” says Vitello. You can also use formulas that use natural or organic products to ensure you’re not putting anything potentially hazardous on your body. “If you’re breastfeeding, we recommend not applying the tanner around the nipple or areola to be extra safe,” adds Hall.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emily Orofino</a> is a beauty writer, editor, and consultant with more than a decade of experience in the industry.
