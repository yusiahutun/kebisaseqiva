If given the choice, everyone would opt for more rather than less power. Yet, to be so overt in attempts to gain power is frowned upon. To attain power, you need to be subtle, cunning, and democratic yet devious. However, regardless of the industry, power can have both positive and negative effects, as anybody who has ever used it knows. On the one hand, it can be beneficial to people. They could, however, misuse it for bad. The distinction between the two is frequently somewhat hazy. Once they have power, some managers feel a sense of comfortable superiority, while others can only devote so much energy to the position. Let’s elevate your life with these ways to became a success full and powerful person.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Here’s the top 10 ways to become a Powerful person.</h4><h5 class=wp-block-heading>1. Never Try to outdo the Master</h5><p>The main idea of this law is to know your place. In front of your superiors, always try to conceal your brilliance. Your master will feel uneasy if you make an attempt to prove that you are smarter.</p><p>Try not to show off your skills too much in your attempt to impress those in positions of authority. Your superiors will look for ways to replace you if they sense insecurity. Don’t take your current popularity for granted, even if it seems well-deserved, as one bad lmove might quickly cause you to lose it.</p><p>Instead, make people in positions of authority look more intelligent and superior to you; for example, solicit their assistance and credit their wise counsel for your ideas. Rather than overshadowing them, give them the spotlight.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>2. Use your enemies and not friends</h5><p>Hire no one you know just because they are pals or as a favor. In addition to limiting your authority since it’s more difficult to maintain a professional distance, friends are more prone to envie you and betray you. Hiring individuals that can further your interests through their talents and competencies is preferable.</p><p>In reality, you can benefit more from your opponents; utilize them to incite fear or mobilize support for your cause. A former adversary will also have more to prove and perhaps be more devoted than a buddy if you can win them over. The issue is that, frequently, you do not know your friends as well as you think you do. In order to prevent conflict, friends frequently agree on tilings. To avoid upsetting one another, they hide their ugly sides. When each other makes a joke, they laugh even more. You might never know how a buddy really feels because friendships are rarely strengthened by honesty. Friends may say things like “I love your poetry,” “I adore your music,” or “I envy your fashion sense,” but oftentimes, they don’t mean it.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>The Powerful Connection Between Mental Health and Spirituality</a></strong></p><p>You slowly find out the qualities a friend has hidden when you decide to hire them. Ironically, it’s your deed of generosity that throws everything out of proportion. People desire to believe that their good fortune is their own. Receiving a favor might become onerous because it implies that you were selected more for your friendship than for your merit. The act of hiring friends that severely affects them nearly seems condescending. The wound will heal gradually: A little more candor, occasional jealousy and resentment spurts, and before you realize it, your friendship wanes. The more presents and favors you provide to keep up the friendship, the less appreciation you get in return.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>3. Conceal your intentions</h5><p>A lot of people are open books because they lack <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">self-control</a> or because they think that being truthful will win people over. It is preferable to hold the initiative by withholding your objective until you are prepared to act.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>Use these two potent strategies to hide your actual goal:</h6><li>Deceive others by feigning support for a viewpoint or notion that goes against your own interests. Alternatively, express a sincere opinion about a little matter; people will take your earnestness for truth and accept you if you subsequently lie.</li><li>Use a smokescreen to deceive and divert people. In order to get them to down their guards and follow your lead without recognizing it, show them something you know they can relate to. Combine this with other smoke screens, such as a heroic gesture, a poker face, or creating a pattern that you will later violate.</li><h5 class=wp-block-heading>4. Always say less than necessary</h5><p>The more you speak, the less commanding and impressive you appear to be, and the greater the likelihood that you will say something foolish.</p><p>People in positions of power seldom speak. People find them remarkable and terrifying since they can’t predict their thoughts and pay close attention to everything they say and do. People become defensive in response to brief responses and silences; when they attempt to fill the void with conversation, they reveal important details.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>5. Avoid stepping into Great Man’s shoes</h5><p>Everything that happens first always seems more creative and better than what happens later. To surpass someone who is a wonderful guy or has a well-known parent, you will need to achieve twice as much as they have. Make a change in direction to forge your own identity and name rather than becoming mired in their shadow or trapped in a past that was not your own. Kill the controlling father, discredit his legacy, and rise to prominence by shining in your own unique manner.</p><p>Appearing greater than others is a prerequisite for power, and you cannot project such a presence when you are buried under the father, the king, or the great antecedent.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>6. Court Attention at all cost</h5><p>You have to make an impression since appearances are important. Make yourself stand out from the crowd by being bigger, more intriguing, and more enigmatic. Remember that power comes with any kind of notoriety. Being maligned is better than being disregarded.</p><p>Keeping a certain amount of mystery surrounding yourself is a good counterweight to this strategy. Hold your cards near the vest. People are drawn to mysterious people. A sense of mystery makes you more noticeable and builds suspense; people will be waiting to see what you will do next.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>7. To protect yourself, don’t build fortresses—isolating yourself is dangerous</h5><p>You will be depriving yourself of important knowledge if you choose to distance yourself from both the world and your adversaries. You become open to assault because of this. As you are more protected in a crowd, it is always preferable to mix with other individuals. Power derives from social contact since people are social creatures.</p><p>Consequently, you have to center yourself if you want to become powerful. The focus of activity need to be on your. When things seem uncertain, fight the impulse to pull back. Seek out former allies and force yourself into new social groups rather than withdrawing inside.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>Is It Possible To Work With Schizophrenia?</a></strong></p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>8. Don’t commit to anyone</h5><p>Make sure you dedicate yourself solely to your own purpose. At all costs, keep your freedom. You can use this to set people up against one another. You establish respect when you don’t support a cause because you come seem as untouchable. You become known for your independence.</p><p>Don’t commit to anyone, either. Avert minor alterations and disagreements. Pretend to be engaged, but let others handle the combat while you stand by and observe. Frequently, inciting arguments between two parties and then gaining control by mediating disputes can be a clever strategy.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>9. Concentrate your forces</h5><p>Concentrate all of your resources into one power source to conserve them. Find a single spring that will last you for a very long period when searching for such a source. Finding one rich source gives you greater power than switching between numerous shallow sources.</p><p>Concentrated power is present. Any organization will have a tiny number of individuals pulling all the strings. They will be the source of power. Thus, power is like oil: all it takes is one blow to guarantee a lifetime of prosperity and influence.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>Top 10 Self-Help Books for Women to Read in 2024</a></strong></p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>10. Recreate Yourself</h5><p>Reject the role that you have been assigned by society. Create a distinctive persona that draws attention to yourself. Take control of your image instead of allowing other people define it for you. Transform yourself into a powerful persona as though you were made of clay.</p><p>You must first develop self-awareness and emotional control in order to accomplish this. Next, you need to develop an iconic character. From here, you can develop your ability to assume many roles and adjust to the needs of any given circumstance. But keep in mind that acting too dramatic can backfire.</p>Reference+<ul><li>https://name-fame.com/book-summary/the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene</li><li>https://businessyield.com/family-helping/48-laws-of-power</li></ul><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Social</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Empowering Minds: Revolutionizing Teenage Mental Health in India</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Social</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Psychological First Aid (PFA): An Immediate Assistance to</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Unmasking Shadow: The Silent Battle of a Victim</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 28, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Life Style</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>“From being peaceful to into pieces”: The Inner</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 28, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Positive</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Aham Brahmasmi: Deciding Your Self-Image</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 27, 2024<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sb%2FYnJ%2BopJ%2BcwG%2BvzqZmraegYn5xedaasKxlpKR6o7HCqKSeZaCkxKa%2Bxa6jZqiVp8Cwuo4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftop-10-ways-to-become-powerful-person.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftop-10-ways-to-become-powerful-person.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftop-10-ways-to-become-powerful-person.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftop-10-ways-to-become-powerful-person.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftop-10-ways-to-become-powerful-person.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftop-10-ways-to-become-powerful-person.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-richard-burgi-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-richard-burgi-dating.html>Who is Richard Burgi Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lady-gabriella-windsor-royal-wedding-dress.html>Lady Gabriella Windsor stuns in Luisa Beccaria wedding dress</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lady-gabriella-windsor-royal-wedding-dress.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
