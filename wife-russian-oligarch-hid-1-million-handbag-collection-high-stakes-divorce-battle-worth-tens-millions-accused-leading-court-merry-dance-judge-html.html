class=mol-para-with-font>According to the judge, she also 'downplayed the bags', saying it would be disproportionate to even have them valued.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr Justice Peel said in his judgement handed down at the High Court that the case had been 'infected by&nbsp;[Ms Khayrova's] dishonesty from start to finish'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He added that she&nbsp;'led the
