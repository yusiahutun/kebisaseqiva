OP (a.k.a. the original poster) began.</p><p>She went on to explain: "My (43F) son (10M) had a sleepover this weekend at my house with 4 other boys.

"Quick and easy breakfast for a fun morning. I typically make things like eggs, toast, fruits/smoothies but again I thought it was a special occasion."</p><p>Of course, this wouldn't be a story if there wasn't some controversy.</p><p>"One of the boys told his mom I guess and I got a horrible facebook message saying I'm terrible for feeding my kids this and that I'm going to make him obese," she wrote.</p><p>"I tried to explain but she just said her son wasn't going there again and blocked me. As far as I know, her son does not have any health issues in which eating a donut would be super detrimental to him."</p><p>The confused mom, then concluded her post by asking AITA (am I the a--hole)?</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5a329320-771a-46e8-a522-d7f45b7b9704 data-container-ref=toofab:article:aaae003c-9b05-4980-9383-0cccc789eb3b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ea/5by4/2024/01/31/ea5565140cf94741945e12c7cedb9d9f_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty Stock Image</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Woman Goes Topless to Dinner in Fight with Mother-in-Law -- Internet Applauds</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h3 class=h3>"Send a Tray of Celery & Carrot Sticks As An Apology. No Dip," And Other Reddit Advice</h3><p>Almost no one took the side of the anti-donut mom.</p><p>In fact, what came next was an avalanche of parents listing all the gloriously unhealthy food one should expect at a 10-year-old's sleepover party.</p><p>From pizza to the aforementioned donuts to french toast to a hilarious anectdote about kids drinking coffee to feel "adult" (which really meant a drop of coffee in a glass full of creamer).</p><p>But perhaps the funniest comments came from Redditors giving fake advice on how to respond to the irate health food obsessed mom.</p><p>"Send a box of donuts to the mom as an apology," one sly commenter quipped.</p><p class=quote-block__text>Poor kid has an almond mom.</p><p>But an even more sadistic response came in reply to that message: "Nay, I'd send a tray of celery and carrot sticks as an apology. No dip. I prefer my petty with a side of malicious compliance. Besides, the poor doughnuts would be wasted," another commenter advised.</p><p>While someone else noted: "As a girl sleepover I thought it was ritual that the dad always went and got donuts in the morning."</p><p>Another commenter noted they felt OP was totally in the right as long as she didn't regularly feed her kids donuts -- to which she replied: "Def not every day!! Maybe 3 times a year haha".</p><p>Others, however, expressed compassion for the boy growing up with such an apparently controlling mom.</p><p>"Really sucks for her kid," wrote one Redditor and noted the boy's social life will likely suffer because of his parent. While someone else observed, "Poor kid has an almond mom."</p><p>Another advised: "Donuts after a sleepover sounds perfectly normal and delightful. If this kid's mom didn't want her kid to have sugary sweets, she should have let you know ahead of time. Also just wondering what she was expecting to happen food-wise at a sleepover."</p><p>"Yes thank you that was my thought too!!" OP said in reply. "I wouldn't have done it had I known there would be an issue with it."</p><p>What do you think?</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0b881889-65d9-4eba-98fe-a1c957ee5f01 data-container-ref=toofab:article:aaae003c-9b05-4980-9383-0cccc789eb3b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ba/5by4/2023/11/29/bac298b58278428aa69bf094c1efff82_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Mom Demands Daughter Be Invited to Bully's Birthday Party, Internet Has Theories</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2xmaW5foryuecGlppyjlZl6p7HEnaCnn12kr6a%2FxGadqKeUYsCtscSppq%2BdomQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmom-blocked-feeding-obese-food-sleepover.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmom-blocked-feeding-obese-food-sleepover.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmom-blocked-feeding-obese-food-sleepover.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmom-blocked-feeding-obese-food-sleepover.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmom-blocked-feeding-obese-food-sleepover.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmom-blocked-feeding-obese-food-sleepover.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tori-spelling-and-jennie-garth-tease-upcoming-projects-together.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tori-spelling-and-jennie-garth-tease-upcoming-projects-together.html>Tori Spelling Shares Cute Pic With BFF Jennie Garth: Working Hard or Hardly Working?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./pear-eggnog-french-toast.html>How to Make Pear &amp;amp; Eggnog French Toast</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./pear-eggnog-french-toast.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
