Luckily for the pair, it was perhaps destiny that everything fell in place at just the right time.</strong></p><p>When you meet someone at work, you can connect on different levels; you begin to wonder whether he/she is your soulmate. As signs point towards this being the case, you wish you could marry that person.</p><p><strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong> probably never realized she would end up marrying the man she hired in the first place. Luckily for the pair, it was perhaps destiny that everything fell in place at just the right Time.</p><h2>Sarah Huckabee Sanders' Married Life</h2><p>Sarah Huckabee Sanders is married to her husband, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Bryan Chatfield Sanders</strong></a>. The couple tied the knot in 2010.</p><p>The pair first met while working together on her father's 2008 presidential campaign. Bryan had been working for then-Kansas Senator <strong>Sam Brownback</strong> and his presidential campaign. Sarah later hired her future husband after Brownback's campaign was folded.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/08/b12a8e670edcaf9fa4ff9a82691f3b15-custom.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders with her husband, Bryan Chatfield Sanders</strong></p><p><strong>Source: Pinterest</strong></p><p>Bryan was hired along with one of his colleagues. Talking with The Hill in 2010, Sarah said:</p><p>"They were both kind of cute, [so I said,] ‘Well, we might be able to work something out’ — kidding a little bit there."</p><p>After the campaign ended, Huckabee and Sanders continued to date. The couple was subsequently engaged in 2009 on Bryan's family ranch in Kansas.</p><p>The lovebirds' big day arrived on 25th May 2010. The ceremony took place in St. John in the Virgin Islands.</p><p>Sarah expressed her joy on Twitter as she tweeted:</p><p>"Big day today! Going to the chapel and going to get married."</p><p>The couple shares three children; two sons named <strong>William Huckabee Sanders</strong> (born on 16th October 2013) and <strong>George Sanders</strong> (born on 8th June 2015), and a daughter named&nbsp;<strong>Scarlett Wiles Sanders</strong> (born on 10th May 2012).</p><p>Her relationship with her children is quite open. In 2017, she wished Scarlett, on the eve of her 5th Birthday, on live TV. After her eldest child Scarlett was born, she revealed it to her fans via Twitter and even mentioned her baptism. Her godparents are <strong>Chip Saltsman</strong> and <strong>Katie Beth Harris</strong>.</p><p>Sarah often talks about her children. Moreover, she loves posting photos on social media.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Happy birthday <a href=#>@GovMikeHuckabee</a> the best dad and papa we could ever ask for! We love you! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7NEh758GjV</a></p>— Sarah Sanders (@SarahHuckabee) <a href=#>August 25, 2015</a><p>In July 2017, during a press briefing at the White House, Sarah spoke about her proud moment as the first working mom to gain the press secretary position.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;"That says less about me than it does about this president. Empowering working moms is the heart of the president’s agenda, particularly when it comes to things like tax reform."</p><p>She continued:</p><p>"Scarlett and every little girl in America should grow up in a country that — if we deliver on the president’s agenda better jobs, better health care, and a better tax system — incentivizes women to work and raise children."</p><p>Sarah added, as a working mom, it's not lost on her what a great honor and privilege it was to stand there at the podium.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>WATCH: <a href=#>@WhiteHouse</a> <a href=#>@PressSec</a> Sarah Sanders says raising young children "perfectly prepared me to deal with the White House press corps." <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/f1QKMuFMZR</a></p>— The View (@TheView) <a href=#>September 6, 2017</a><p>Sarah further joked with reporters by claiming the chaos in her home with three growing kids prepared her for the White House and dealing with the press corps.</p><p>Huckabee claims she wakes up at 5 a.m. daily to spend time with her spouse and kids. She told the New York Times she loves talking about her family, and it comes naturally, saying, "That's just kind of who I am."</p><h2>The Couple Founded A Consulting Firm In 2016</h2><p>In 2016, Bryan, and his wife, founded a second Street Strategies consulting firm. The firm was located in Little Rock, Arkansas, where the pair lived at the Time.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/08/drwghucw0aeouf8-custom.jpg alt

development, and advertising production and placement for candidates, independent expenditure committees, businesses, and non-profits."</p><p>Since Sarah Huckabee Sanders seems extremely committed to working in the White House, the company appears to be on hold.</p><h2>Sarah Huckabee Sanders: Quick Facts</h2><p>&nbsp;<img
