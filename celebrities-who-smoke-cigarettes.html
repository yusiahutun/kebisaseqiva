The British songwriter has sold millions of albums worldwide and won at least 15 Grammys and an Oscar. Adele has been seen enjoying the occasional cigarette several times throughout her career, and she is not shy to admit it. A few years ago, she decided to quit smoking to improve her vocals. However, she later told the media that quitting smoking actually damaged her voice. She said that it left her with a weaker voice. Since then, Adele has produced a couple of hit songs, and her vocals have never sounded better. Maybe she still occasionally puffs on a cig out of the public eye!</p><h2>Kate Winslet</h2><p>Kate Winslet is a British actress popularly known for her role in the Titanic movie. Kate is not just a smoker; she admits to rolling her own cigarettes as well. If that isn’t enthusiasm, we don’t know what it is! She states that she picked up the habit when she was 19, and she has been enjoying the occasional puff since then, especially with her morning mug of coffee. However, Kate states that she does not smoke in her house or around her kids. However, she was once spotted having a cig while shopping with her baby, Mia, who was strapped to her back.</p><h2>Johnny Depp</h2><p>The famous American actor, producer, and musician is one of Hollywood’s favorite stars. He has been nominated for three Academy Awards and has won the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Awards several times. Johnny is not afraid of admitting his love for the cigarette. In a previous interview, the movie mogul jokingly claimed that he smokes a thousand cigarettes a day. “I am working my way up to ten thousand,” he said. He has been occasionally photographed while puffing on a cigarette as he goes about his daily errands.</p><h2>Zayn Malik</h2><p>Zayn is a popular English singer and songwriter who is famous for his song I Don’t Wanna Live Forever which even featured in the movie Fifty Shades Darker. The singe loves his cigarettes, and he is not shy to let the world know. Zayn has been spotted puffing away on several occasions throughout his music career. The star even has a tattoo on his hand of a woman’s lips with smoke curling out. Zayn also posts smoking selfies on Instagram, and he was once spotted enjoying a cigarette while basking in the sun.</p><h2>Mila Kunis</h2><p>You all know her from the TV show Friends with Benefits. However, what you may not know is that Mila Kunis is a cig lover. Despite her huge career and adorable fan base, Mila can’t kick the unhealthy habit of smoking. She has told many people that it isn’t really a habit but the number of smoking photos we see around seem to prove otherwise. Her husband, Kutcher, was a smoker as well, but he has since quit. Maybe he can give her some tips on how to quit?</p><h2>Gwyneth Paltrow</h2><p>Gwyneth wows her fans with her healthy lifestyle and dedicated workouts which have helped her maintain a youthful figure even at the age of 46. However, this American actress, lifestyle guru, and food writer can’t say no to the cigarette. The mum of two who recently wrote a healthy eating cookbook admits that she has at least one cigarette every week. She even revealed that smoking is a guilty pleasure, and she even took lessons on how to smoke dope using a vaping device. But she had to do this in California where the drug is legal.</p><p>It may come as a surprise that your favorite celebrities who seem to have healthy lifestyles are not all that perfect. They have vices, and for some, it’s an inability to resist the cigarette. However, they say “you only live once,” and if a cigarette is what it takes to have fun and enjoy life, let them have it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxlp528br%2FMqKKeZZOetKK%2BxK2rnqtf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcelebrities-who-smoke-cigarettes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcelebrities-who-smoke-cigarettes.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcelebrities-who-smoke-cigarettes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcelebrities-who-smoke-cigarettes.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcelebrities-who-smoke-cigarettes.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcelebrities-who-smoke-cigarettes.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./coleen-rooney-four-wedding-dresses-wayne-rooney-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./coleen-rooney-four-wedding-dresses-wayne-rooney-photos.html>Coleen Rooney's four wedding dresses with husband Wayne are nothing alike</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./best-places-to-sell-feet-pics-online-make-money.html>Best Places to Sell Feet Pics Online &amp;amp; Make Money</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./best-places-to-sell-feet-pics-online-make-money.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
