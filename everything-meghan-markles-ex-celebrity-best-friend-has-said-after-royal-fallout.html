They took several vacations together and also featured on each other’s Instagram. Jessica Mulroney also played a key role at <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and Prince Harry’s wedding in 2018. She entered the St George’s Chapel with none other than <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a>. However, since the Duchess of Sussex left the royal family, reports of an alleged rift between them have been rife.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-620135906-717x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-best-moments-from-meghan-markle-and-jessica-mulroney-s-friendship>Best moments from Meghan Markle and Jessica Mulroney’s friendship</h2><p>The Daily Mail <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">notes</a> that Meghan and Jessica’s friendship presumably started in 2011 when the Duchess was still living in Toronto and began working on Suits. The Canadian stylist and marketing consultant is believed to have helped pick out the wedding dress Meghan’s Suits character Rachel Zane wore on the show.</p><p>In 2018, royal expert Katie Nicholl <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Cosmopolitan, “They went to the same yoga and Pilates and became firm friends.” Meghan really looks up to Jessica. She thinks she’s a talented person, a wonderful mother, and a great best friend.”</p><p>Meghan even raved about her friend on her now-defunct blog The Tig. She reportedly described the Canadian stylist and television personality as “savvy and fashionable and tres cool, and also va va va voom pritaaaay.”</p><p>The Duchess also praised Jessica, writing, “And here’s the other thing – she also happens to be an incredible stylist, clothing the likes of Canada’s First Lady, Sophie Trudeau.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1202993916-724x1024.jpg><p>Between 2016 and 2017, the two often featured on each other’s <a href=#>Instagram</a>. In February 2016, Jessica had reportedly teased a trip to the Cayman Islands with Meghan. Jessica also shared snaps of the two fashion-loving ladies sipping cocktails at sunset and having fun in the sun on the Amalfi coast. The stylist also accompanied the Duchess to her first Invictus Games appearance in 2017.</p><p>Rumors suggest that Jessica was the first person Meghan reached out to after <a href=#>Prince Harry </a>proposed. Moreover, both Jessica’s sons and daughter were involved in the royal wedding. A year later, Jessica was among Meghan’s list of friends who organized her baby shower in New York City.</p><p>Jessica was among the first of Meghan’s friends to comment on her treatment by the media during her years with the royal family. At a time when the Sussexes were being slammed for their use of private jets, despite being outspoken environmentalists, Jessica took to Instagram to call their criticism unfair.</p><p>“When someone faces unfair criticism, you call it out. When that person is your friend and your family, you call those critics what they truly are,” she reportedly wrote, “Shame on you, you racist bullies.”</p><p>Months after Meghan and Harry’s royal exit in 2020, Jessica landed in a controversy of her own when influencer Sasha Exeter called her out in the “white privilege” row. To deal with the backlash, Jessica seemingly referenced Meghan’s experience in the royals.</p><p>“As I told you privately, I have lived a very public and personal experience with my&nbsp;closest friend where race was front and center. It was deeply educational,” she commented on one of Sasha’s posts.</p><p>The Duchess reportedly did not appreciate being involved in Jessica’s very public controversy.</p><p>An <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">insider</a> told Page Six that their friendship was already strained because Meghan felt that Jessica was trying to “make a career out of the friendship.”</p><p>Now Jessica is seemingly taking digs at her former friend through her social media.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jessica-s-cryptic-post-seemingly-aimed-at-meghan>Jessica’s cryptic post seemingly aimed at Meghan</h2><p>In December 2023, Jessica reposted a video by @WomennSoul on her Instagram Story. It featured an unidentified woman talking about people who do not see both sides of a story.</p><p>“Anybody who believes lies about you, before even hearing your side of the story, was already looking for a way to be against you,” she says.</p><p>Although the stylist did not add any context to the clip, many were quick to assume it had something to do with Meghan.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2V%2FcLHVnqmyrJieu6h5zJ6eoZmeYrqivsqlnKxlla16pLHLnpmroaSueqOx0q1kn6qZmruleceaqmarkZ6xbq3FrZyrZaKkxqK4jJ%2BYpaSfqsFw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feverything-meghan-markles-ex-celebrity-best-friend-has-said-after-royal-fallout.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2feverything-meghan-markles-ex-celebrity-best-friend-has-said-after-royal-fallout.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2feverything-meghan-markles-ex-celebrity-best-friend-has-said-after-royal-fallout.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2feverything-meghan-markles-ex-celebrity-best-friend-has-said-after-royal-fallout.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feverything-meghan-markles-ex-celebrity-best-friend-has-said-after-royal-fallout.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2feverything-meghan-markles-ex-celebrity-best-friend-has-said-after-royal-fallout.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-to-group-worksheets-in-excel.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-to-group-worksheets-in-excel.html>How to Group Worksheets in Excel</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./beyonce-barbie-hot-pink-platform-heels-minidress.html>Beyonce Channeled Barbie in Hot Pink Platform Heels and a Skintight Minidress</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./beyonce-barbie-hot-pink-platform-heels-minidress.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
