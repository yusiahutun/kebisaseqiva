One advantage Vivian has had in her acting career is her resemblance to her mother, Melissa McCarthy. In the 2016 movie “The Boss,” Vivian was paid $880 daily to play the younger version of McCarthy’s character, Michelle Darnell.</p><p>The role was an excellent opportunity for Vivian to showcase her acting skills and gain valuable experience in the industry. As her mother’s “mini-me,” Vivian has the potential to play younger versions of Melissa McCarthy’s characters in future projects.</p><p>Despite her young age, Vivian is carving out a successful acting career. However, her father isn’t very psyched about his young daughter getting into the show biz at such an early stage in life. He wants his daughters, Vivian and her younger sister Georgette to focus on their studies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-9_21_9_44.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_the_Young_Rising_Star_Vivian_Falcone></span>Who Is the Young Rising Star, Vivian Falcone? <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Vivian Falcone is a 15-year-old American teenager born on August 5, 2007. She is best known for being the daughter of Hollywood power couple Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone. Vivian has one younger sister, Georgette Falcone. She lives with her family in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>While much is unknown about Vivian’s personal life, we know she schools in one of the reputable high schools in her region. Both parents often reference how focused they want their daughters to be on their education. Vivian loves basketball, which she took from her mum, and her growth in the movie industry is very out in the open.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Vivian_Falcone_Started_Her_Journey_in_Hollywood></span>How Vivian Falcone Started Her Journey in Hollywood<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Vivian Falcone began her acting career at a young age, making her debut in the 2016 comedy film “The Boss,” directed by her father, Ben Falcone. In the movie, her resemblance to her mother proved advantageous, as Vivian secured the role of the younger version of the character her mother was playing.</p><p>Vivian’s younger sister, Georgette, also briefly appeared in the film. Despite their parents’ reservations about them pursuing acting as a career, Vivian’s performance in “The Boss” demonstrated her potential and passion for the craft.</p><p>In 2021, Vivian Falcone returned to the big screen in the American superhero comedy film “Thunder Force,” again directed by her father, Ben Falcone. Once again, Vivian portrayed a younger version of her mother’s character.</p><p>While the movie received mixed reviews from critics, it garnered a massive viewership on Netflix within a month of its release. Due to her movie credits, Vivian Falcone accumulated a $1.5 million net worth at a young age.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-9_21_10_58.jpg><p>Aside from acting, Vivian Falcone has interests in interior design and sports, much like her mother. Her parents have clarified that they prioritize their education and do not want her and Georgette to pursue acting immediately.</p><p>However, Vivian’s talent and passion for performing have already earned her a place in Hollywood. With her parent’s support and guidance, there’s no doubt that she will continue to make a name for herself in the industry.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Vivian_Falcones_Mother_Melissa_McCarthy></span>Vivian Falcone’s Mother, Melissa McCarthy<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Melissa McCarthy</a> is a well-known actress, comedian, and writer. McCarthy began her career in stand-up comedy in Los Angeles before moving to New York. Her breakthrough role was as Sookie St. James in the popular television show, “The Gilmore Girls.” Since then, she has appeared in numerous films and television shows, including “Bridesmaids,” “Ghostbusters,” and “Mike & Molly.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-9_21_12_0.jpg><p>McCarthy has spoken publicly about her daughter Vivian, sharing a passion for interior design. During an appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” in 2018, McCarthy shared that Vivian has a strong sense of aesthetics and often offers thoughtful opinions on her mother’s design choices. McCarthy expressed her pride in Vivian’s talents and compared it to the feeling of a Texas dad watching his son play football.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Ben_Falcone_Vivians_Dad></span>Who Is Ben Falcone, Vivian’s Dad?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ben Falcone is also in the entertainment industry. He met his wife Melissa in a comedy writing class in 1998. They married in 2005, and Vivian was born in May 2007, during the final season of “The Gilmore Girls.” McCarthy hoped that her daughter would inherit more of her husband’s calm traits and less of her “spazzy” ones.</p><p>The couple welcomed their second daughter, Georgette, in 2010. While Ben and McCarthy are adamant about their children finishing school before acting full-time, they support them unconditionally.</p><p>Vivian Falcone isn’t the only celebrity kid following in her parent’s footsteps. Bindi Irwin and her brother Robert followed in the footsteps of their father, <a href=#>Steve Irwin</a>, in conserving wildlife.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kw6rCyJqlZp6RobCwusRmq6Gho2KwprjEm6mirKliuKqwjKKqZpldp7a0tc2gZKyskad8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvivian-falcone-this-celebrity-kid-is-a-rising-star.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fvivian-falcone-this-celebrity-kid-is-a-rising-star.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fvivian-falcone-this-celebrity-kid-is-a-rising-star.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fvivian-falcone-this-celebrity-kid-is-a-rising-star.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvivian-falcone-this-celebrity-kid-is-a-rising-star.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvivian-falcone-this-celebrity-kid-is-a-rising-star.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./qkqjgzfdc69xrrnhwl4wolzemzb8tsrz.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./qkqjgzfdc69xrrnhwl4wolzemzb8tsrz.html>Watch Half &amp;amp; Half Season 2 Episode 10: The Big Bitter Baby Show Episode</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./patrick-j-lynch.html>Patrick J.
