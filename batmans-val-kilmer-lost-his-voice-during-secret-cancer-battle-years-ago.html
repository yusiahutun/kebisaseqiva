The celebrity actually kept the ordeal hush for a long time before coming clean with fans. However, the harsh results of the disease lead to Val Kilmer not being able to use his voice – something an actor relies on.</strong></p><p>In 2017, after initially denying reports he was battling cancer, Val Kilmer later admitted he was diagnosed with the disease. In a personal Q&A with fans on Reddit, also known as an Ask Me Anything thread, he came clean. It came five months after denying health concerns when a fellow <a href=#>movie</a> star had unknowingly announced it at an event in October 2016. Michael Douglas had said Val Kilmer was “dealing with exactly what I had”, referring to oral cancer. But this didn’t go down well. The Doors star later denied it on his official Facebook page, implying the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> actor apologized to him.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-val-kilmer-admitted-to-fans-he-did-have-cancer>Val Kilmer admitted to fans he did have cancer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1184088543-804x1024.jpg><p>Despite writing on social media Michael Douglas reached out “apologizing for suggesting to press overseas, I ‘wasn’t doing too well’,” he admitted to fans he did have it.</p><p>During the Reddit <a href=# rel=nofollow>thread</a>, a fan asked about the incident, trying to get to the bottom of the confusion.</p><p>They asked: “A while ago, Michael Douglass claimed you had terminal cancer. What was the story about that?”</p><p>Val Kilmer was candid in his reply. He wrote: “He was probably trying to help me ’cause press probably asked where I was these days, and I did have a healing of cancer, but my tongue is still swollen although healing all the time.</p><p>“Because I don’t sound my normal self yet people think I may still be under the weather.”</p><p>The Q&A session was to promote Cinema Twain, a film rendition of his one-mage show Citizen Twain, about the famous Huckleberry Finn author Mark Twain.</p><p>As Val Kilmer battled cancer, he underwent two tracheotomies and chemotherapy. But as he admitted to fans, it was a huge setback as his voice is yet to return.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-val-kilmer-s-voice-came-back-through-ai>Val Kilmer’s voice came back through AI</h2><p>Despite the star losing his voice, Val Kilmer came back to the silver screen for the sequel Top Gun: Maverick. AI technology was used by feeding hours of audio recordings of the <a href=#>celebrity</a> to create a digital version of his voice.</p><p>It opened the door for him to continue acting, despite losing the ability to speak after his throat cancer treatment back in 2014.</p><p>The Heat star announced in August 2021 he had partnered with Sonantic to create the digital voice.</p><p>“I’m grateful to the entire team at Sonantic who masterfully restored my voice in a way I’ve never imagined possible,” Val Kilmer said at the time.</p><p>“As human beings, the ability to communicate is the core of our existence, and the side effects from throat cancer have made it difficult for others to understand me. The chance to narrate my story, in a voice that feels authentic and familiar, is an incredibly special gift.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hollywood-star-initially-didn-t-want-top-gun-role>Hollywood star initially didn’t want Top Gun role</h2><p>It’s hard to imagine Top Gun without the Iceman, but the classic actor actually didn’t want the part initially.</p><p>But it’s a good thing he bit the bullet, as it turned into his big break. Top Gun became the highest-grossing movie of 1986 and helped elevate Val’s career.</p><p>In the star’s autobiography, he confessed he ‘begged’ producers to include him on the bill for the sequel. He also praises lead actor <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a> for getting involved to make it happen.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2eDcK7AraSapqNiw6K4jKSgpaWVp3qtu9KtZKGho2LDsLXCnmSdraKeu6h50p6aq52kYrCiusKeqWaakanBrbGMspyaqqNirqi7jg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbatmans-val-kilmer-lost-his-voice-during-secret-cancer-battle-years-ago.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbatmans-val-kilmer-lost-his-voice-during-secret-cancer-battle-years-ago.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbatmans-val-kilmer-lost-his-voice-during-secret-cancer-battle-years-ago.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbatmans-val-kilmer-lost-his-voice-during-secret-cancer-battle-years-ago.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbatmans-val-kilmer-lost-his-voice-during-secret-cancer-battle-years-ago.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbatmans-val-kilmer-lost-his-voice-during-secret-cancer-battle-years-ago.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./christmas-eve-candle.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./christmas-eve-candle.html>Christmas Eve 13 oz.
