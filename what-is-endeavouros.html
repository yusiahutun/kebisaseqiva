Most distributions are built on other distributions. Ubuntu is based on Debian, Manjaro is based on Arch, and Fedora is based on RedHat Linux.</p><p>Arch Linux isn't based on anything. It was built from the ground up using the Linux kernel, the GNU utilities, its own package manager, and so on. Arch Linux lets the user decide exactly what they want to include or leave out of their operating system and applications. It's the polar opposite of bloat. It's just about the skinniest Linux you can get.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ubuntu vs. Manjaro Linux: Which One Should You Choose?</a></span></p><p>Including only what you want results in a <a href=#>lightweight, fast operating system</a>. Why install stuff that isn't going to be of any use to you, just to have it taking up disk space? The fewer moving parts the better.&nbsp;But the granularity of the installation process is off-putting---if not downright intimidating---for many users. It's not for newbies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ironically, one of the driving principles of Arch Linux is KISS. Keep it sweet and simple, yet I know people who have spent&nbsp;weeks&nbsp;trying to get Arch Linux fully functional and stable on a laptop. You learn a lot by installing and maintaining and fixing Arch, but a lot of users don't come to Linux for that. They want "it just works."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why I Switched From Ubuntu to Manjaro Linux</a></span></p><p>Distributions like&nbsp;<a href=#>Manjaro</a>&nbsp;try to bridge the gap. Manjaro is Arch-based, uses the same package manager as Arch Linux, and uses a rolling release model. There's no big update once or twice a year with Arch Linux, it is continually updated as application and operating system patches become available. Manjaro does this too, but with a delay in the patch roll-out process. The delay gives the developers time to fix any bugs that have been spotted in the Arch Linux updates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Manjaro is Arch-based but it isn't Arch Linux. If you really want to run Arch Linux but can't face or fathom the Arch Linux installation, what can you do?&nbsp;That's where&nbsp;<a href=#>EndeavourOS</a>&nbsp;comes in. EndeavourOS delivers as close to plain-vanilla Arch as you can get, without hand-assembling Arch Linux the hard way.</p><p>EndeavourOS uses the well-known Calamares installer. It asks you a set of questions---what is your keyboard layout, which desktop environment do you want, which timezone are you in---and installs Arch Linux the way you want it. In 30 or 40 minutes you have a fully-functional Arch Linux installation, with a few EndeavourOS-specific management tools on top.</p><p>This puts Arch Linux within the reach of everyone.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The 6 Best Lightweight Linux Distros</a></span></p><h2 id=how-to-install-endeavouros>How to Install EndeavourOS</h2><p>Download the&nbsp;<a href=#>EndeavourOS installation ISO</a>&nbsp;and either burn it to a DVD or <a href=#>make a bootable USB drive</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Burn an ISO File to a USB Drive in Linux</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Boot your computer from the install media.
