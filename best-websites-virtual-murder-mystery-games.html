Games are a way for fans to put their sleuthing hats on and unravel cases of their own.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, websites exist that offer virtual murder mystery games for friends and family to play together. All you need is an internet connection, compatible video conferencing software, and the tools each site provides. Here are some great options for your next online sleuthing party.</p><h2 id=why-are-murder-mystery-games-popular>Why Are Murder Mystery Games Popular?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/murder-mystery-game-items.jpg><p>Murder mystery games are trending because of a real-life interest in investigations. That's what makes true crime a genre of its own in literature, documentaries, and podcasts.</p><p>The digital age also lets people learn a lot more about cases and engage with them. In fact, <a href=#>social media users often help solve crimes</a> by gathering information and even sharing insights with police.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While amateur sleuthing does have its pitfalls, virtual and live murder mystery games are far less dangerous. They're a fun way to play detective with friends without the weight of a real investigation on your shoulders.</p><h2 id=teambuilding>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teambuilding</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/teambuilding-ancient-egypt-virtual-murder-mystery-game.png><p>Planning an exciting murder mystery over Zoom isn't easy, but Teambuilding does quite a good job with it. Depending on the size of your group, you'll be competing as individuals or teams. Your goal: solve a historical murder.</p><p>You have three murders to choose from, involving ancient Egypt, the Queen's court, and a famous Speakeasy. Over an hour and a half, you get the story, suspects, clues, and puzzles, some of which are tough enough to satisfy the brainiacs in your group.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once you work out the likeliest scenario,&nbsp;your facilitator reveals the winner—if there is one—and what actually happened all those years ago. The educational part is as satisfying as the teamwork and brainteasers.</p><h2 id=the-murder-mystery-co>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Murder Mystery Co.</a></h2><p>If you want your sleuthing experience to be more interactive, you can’t go wrong with The Murder Mystery Co. It organizes two-hour Zoom events with actors in full costume and carefully planned crimes that incorporate the participants in different roles.</p><p>Each event can host eight to 12 people. You don't have to dress up, but it is encouraged if you want a really memorable party. Costume suggestions come with the information each participant receives about their role before the event.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You arrange the time for The Murder Mystery Co. team to commit the "crime" and start the party. The event has three acts, during which participants can move around breakout rooms to discuss clues, solve puzzles, and so on. Expect lots of fun, twists, and extra treats.</p><h2 id=outback-virtual-team-building-amp-training>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Outback Virtual Team Building & Training</a></h2><p>For a game that's just as immersive but less demanding, try out the Virtual Clue Murder Mystery event by the Outback Virtual Team Building & Training. Aimed at corporate groups, its layout is very straightforward and designed to boost various skills.</p><p>Easy access from any device and conferencing software makes it easy for everyone to join in on the fun. Teamwork, communication, problem-solving, and attention to detail, all come into play as participants dig deeper into the case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether you lead the event yourself or ask for a host, you get a series of 40 to 80 challenges, involving interview videos, case files, tricky clues, and more. This is a virtual murder mystery game that puts you right in the shoes of modern detectives.</p><h2 id=night-of-mystery>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Night of Mystery</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/night-of-mystery-virtual-games.png><p>Hosting your own sleuthing party gives you more control and flexibility over the whole event. Websites like Night of Mystery can plan the crime story, clues, and characters. From there, the online platform, dress code, timing, and so on are up to you.</p><p>Night of Mystery&nbsp;starts at $45 for six to eight players. There are eight themes to pick from, such as Murder at the Juice Joint, Murder at the Deadwood Saloon, and Ho Ho Homicide.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once you buy your package, you can download all the materials you need.

The Night of Mystery team offers loads of tips and tries to make each event unique.</p><h2 id=ghost-ship-murder-mysteries>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost Ship Murder Mysteries</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ghost-ship-murder-mysteries-white-house-package.png><p>This site provides a representative that works with the host to carry out the process, from assigning roles to emailing clues as the story unfolds. Unlike other services, Ghost Ship Murder Mysteries sets its virtual events on a specific social platform: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gather</a>.</p><p>Participants are free to move around a virtual map of different rooms, where they can socialize while playing as&nbsp;either a bystander&nbsp;or murderer. The crime and investigation take place over two hours, ending with a vote and a big reveal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Depending on how many people you're hosting, it can be expensive, typically costing $40 per guest for a private event and $50 for a corporate one.

Even though it offers a professional host to take care of everything, you can stick with a DIY setup. Just use a <a href=#>strong app for group conference calls</a>, dress up if you want, and follow the service's simple steps.</p><p>You get all the information and materials you need for a whole session, including up to 20 characters. Before the event, a special emailing tool can randomly assign roles and distribute instructions to guests. You decide how much effort should go into playing each character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The murder mystery game itself involves three rounds of evidence and questioning. What's different about this website is that it's run by Broadway playwrights and actors, so you can expect high-quality plots to keep you happy for hours.</p><h2 id=red-herring-games>7. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Herring Games</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/red-herring-games-virtual-murder-mystery-options.png><p>If you like the idea of just downloading a murder mystery and playing with online friends, Red Herring Games is yet another site worth exploring.

The DIY layout is the same: you buy a well-rounded themed package, download the files, and use them to organize your murder mystery game on Zoom, Google Hangout, or any other platform.</p><p>The difference here is the range of immersive stories available. You’ll find Christmas and Halloween-themed stories alongside fairytale, steampunk, and espionage-related themes. The website's contents are also updated monthly, so you can always look forward to something new and exciting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=take-your-murder-mystery-games-to-the-next-level>Take Your Murder Mystery Games to the Next Level</h2><p>These websites are a great source of gripping stories to play through.
