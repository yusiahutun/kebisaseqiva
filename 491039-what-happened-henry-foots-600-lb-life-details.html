The <a href=#>famous celebrity</a> was raised alongside his five siblings. Unfortunately, there is little known about his siblings. His father died of liver cancer at a time when he was dealing with his weight loss journey.</p><p class=align-left>In his childhood, Henry is said not to have cared much about his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">eating habits</a> as well as his weight. He started to gain weight starting from his junior <a href=#>high school</a> years and was 715 pounds at his highest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2b0b527d5af7c558.jpg><p class=align-left>During an episode in <i>My 600 lb Life</i>, his mother, Addie Virginia, revealed that Henry would sneak food into the bathroom and hide while eating there.

He was one of the heaviest patients in season 1, weighing 715 pounds. Due to his large body, he faced problems such as knee aches, back pain, and difficulty in movement.

During his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">second surgery</a>, his heart stopped for a while, but thankfully the procedure turned out successful as the doctors revived him. He would later tell TLCâ€™s cameras about the experience:</p>I saw a white light. It was just like having an out-of-body experience, he said. There was the light to take me to heaven, but I wasn't ready for it because there's so much here on earth I have not done yet.<p class=align-left>He saw this as a second chance to live a healthy life and remained even more determined. However, after the two surgeries, Henry struggled to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and it took almost seven years to get his life on track. He eventually registered a remarkable weight loss of 440 pounds by the end of his weight loss journey.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8a71cc15e4369cc3.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Actor Cory Hart's biography: Wife, family, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><h2>Was Henry Foots married?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ec6f1489918eb0fd.jpg><p class=align-left>Henry Foots was married to Lycurgus "Kirk" Walker for almost two years.
