<time>16 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Fame found Francesca Hetfield when she got married to popular musician James Hetfield.&nbsp;</p><p>They welcomed three kids before their relationship ran its course. Even though she continues to garner interest as James’ former wife, Francesca also has her achievements.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fran.jpg><p>Keep reading to find out more about Francesca and her relationship with James.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Francesca_Hetfield></span>Who Is Francesca Hetfield?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Francesca was born Francesca Tomasi in Buenos Aires, Argentina, into what many would call a macho family.&nbsp;In her family, men’s needs were more important than women’s. However, after she met James, her perspective changed because he treated her as an equal at home.&nbsp;</p><p>It was how he was brought up. Speaking about it, James said: “Our household is very 50/50. I think we should all be treated equally.”</p><p>James, who knows about his wife’s background, admitted that he finds it hard to respect a woman too timid to stand before men.&nbsp;He also confessed that he has a thing for strong women. No wonder he fell head over heels with Francesca, who always had a strong constitution.&nbsp;</p><p>She started working at an early age, holding down various jobs. She was a Metallica security crew member before becoming the band’s costume designer.</p><p>Outside fashion, other things Francesca likes include animals, especially cats. Her Instagram bio describes her as a “loyal, honest, mom, crazy cat lady.”&nbsp;Francesca enjoys posting pictures of her cats on her page, demonstrating her immense love for the long-haired felines.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_James_Hetfield_Meet_Francesca></span>How Did James Hetfield Meet Francesca?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>James Hetfield and Francesca Hetfield first met James in 1992, after which they started dating.&nbsp;James proposed to her when they decided to take things to the next step. It happened during a romantic date with James trying many times to get the ring on the table without her noticing.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/frn.jpg><p>To pull it off, he tricked Francesca into thinking there was spinach stuck in her teeth. So, she went to the bathroom.&nbsp;When she returned, it was to meet the ring set on the table with James asking her to marry him. They <a href=#>tied the knot</a> in 1997.</p><p>After their marriage, James and Francesca mostly flew under the radar. However, they often toured together, and she even appeared in the 2004 documentary “Metallica: Some Kind of Monster.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_Francesca_Hetfield_Do_for_a_Living></span>What Does Francesca Hetfield Do for a Living?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Francesca Hetfield is an American costume designer. She started to earn a living after graduating high school as a waitress at a bar near her home. She did not attend college but went on to establish her career in the costume design industry by the age of 23.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Francesca_Hetfields_Net_Worth></span>Francesca Hetfield’s Net Worth&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to some sources, Francesca is worth approximately $1 million.

During that time, they weathered many storms — for example, James’ addiction. In an interview from 2017, the singer revealed that his struggles with addiction almost cost him his family at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>It made Francesca kick him out of their home, and eventually, she advised him to see a therapist. He later checked into a rehab center and got sober, changing his life completely.&nbsp;Francesca and James have three children: their daughters, Cali Tee and Marcella Francesca, and a son Castor Virgil.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/meta.jpg><p>All three kids inherited their father’s affinity for arts and have found rewarding work in arts and entertainment.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Francesca_and_James_Still_Together></span>Are Francesca and James Still Together?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, Francesca and James are no longer together. They filed for divorce in 2022, with many sources claiming it happened secretly earlier in the year.&nbsp;</p><p>Their fans did not catch a whiff of it until later, but the couple had made their decision. &nbsp;Couples like them that divorced after long years of dedication to each other include Jennifer Flavin and Sylvester Stallone, Billy Ray Cyrus and Tish Cyrus, and <a href=#>Kris Jenner</a> and Caitlyn Jenner.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZp6ilruksdKcmGaglamzqrHLnWSjmZ2awG60xK2dop2cmcBuss6rpJ6qXay2p7GO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-francesca-hetfield-james-hetfields-former-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-francesca-hetfield-james-hetfields-former-wife.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-francesca-hetfield-james-hetfields-former-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-francesca-hetfield-james-hetfields-former-wife.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-francesca-hetfield-james-hetfields-former-wife.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-francesca-hetfield-james-hetfields-former-wife.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lisa-sthalekar.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lisa-sthalekar.html>Who is Lisa Sthalekar dating?
