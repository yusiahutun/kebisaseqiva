Since joining the entertainment industry, she has amassed lots of accolades. She is also a writer and a sought-after producer. She has earned respectable <a href=# title="Wendy Williams" rel="nofollow noopener">nicknames </a>such as "The Queen of Radio" and "The queen of All-Media."</p><h2>Wendy Williams bio</h2><ul><li><strong>Full name: </strong>Wendy Joan Williams</li><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 18th July 1964</li><li><strong>Zodiac sign:</strong> Cancer</li><li><strong>Height</strong>: 1.78 meters or 5' 10"</li><li><strong>Wendy's catchphrase: </strong>"How you doin'?"</li></ul><h2>Wendy's early life</h2><p class=align-left>Wendy was born on 18th July 1964 in the Asbury Park community of New Jersey, United States. She recently described her childhood as a <a href=# title="Wendy Williams" rel="nofollow noopener">tortured one</a>. While growing up, she was fat-shamed and bullied, but this has never distracted her from being her best and utilizing her talent to the max.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0d6dae7c90366ab8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Heather Storm from Garage Squad? The true story</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Wendy attended Ocean Township High School. Besides her excellent performance in school, she was also a member of her school marching band, playing the clarinet. She, later on, joined Northeastern University. The young Wendy studied there and then graduated in 1986. She holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Communications from this institution.</p><h2>Wendy's radio career</h2><p class=align-left>By the time she commenced her career about 31 years ago, radio hosting was already in her blood. The star had already begun her experience while still a student at Northeastern University. Here, she worked as the institution's radio DJ in their Boston offices.</p><p class=align-left>Once Wendy was done with her college studies, she started working at a station based in the Virgin Islands. But she earned her major break after joining two radio stations, one based in New York and the other in Washington DC.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0d6dae7c90366ab8.jpeg><p class=align-left>It took her only a few years to join the league of the most popular local DJs. As a result, she got a job offer at a Philadelphia radio station. It was at this urban studio that she began reinventing herself as a more transparent radio host.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1dca0d001e7f08c5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Where is Desiree Washington now? Life story and latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Then came the late 1990s, an era that saw a spike in popularity in shock jock hosts. Wendy brought something new to the table, and no other female presenter had taken part in this. The star discussed her past issues openly on air, and her sincerity won numerous local listeners' hearts.</p><p class=align-left>The new century brought with it a new version of Wendy, the radio host. She decided to switch from the 'confessional' approach to adopting a syndicated show in New York.</p><h2>Her stint at the Wendy Williams Show</h2><p class=align-left>The summer of 2008 was an eventful period for Wendy as she enhanced her TV exposure significantly via The Wendy Williams Show that aired on BET. The ratings increased fast, motivating executives to allow the show to run on full-scale come the next summer.</p><p class=align-left>In November, the same year, she got the induction honour into the National Radio Hall of Fame. During this period, she was still waiting for her new program to premiere.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dde352cde91a828c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rhea Hughes bio: Husband, divorce, salary, brother, home, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It was until 13th June 2009 that she debuted her own TV show that drew inspiration from her recent radio show. Here, she combined celebrity dirt, interviews, and advice to her audience. By the last day of July 2009, Wendy had already made it clear that she was quitting radio.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3c2f605d4c3f78db.jpg><p class=align-left>The Wendy Williams Show has run successfully over the years and has garnered several Emmy nominations.</p><h2>How much is the net worth of Wendy Williams?</h2><p class=align-left>Her career has spanned more than three decades. Wendy's unmatched motivation and larger-than-life attributes have earned her financial success. She is currently worth <a href=# title="Wendy Williams" rel="nofollow noopener">$40 million</a>.</p><p class=align-left>She has made this amount through her different stints in the entertainment industry. Between her publications, endorsement deals, and her hosting role at her TV show, the star earns about<a href=# title="Wendy Williams" rel="nofollow noopener"> $15 million</a> annually.</p><h2>Was Wendy Williams man?</h2><p class=align-left>This is a common question among her fans and social media followers alike. She often addresses the Wendy Williams transgender rumours jokingly. She refuted the claims, stating that people believe she was born a man because of her tough face, strong body, and height. But that's not true.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6a0374a176a7e561.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Afton Smith: Brendan Fraser divorce story and latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>According to Wendy, this rumour is why she says she had a tortured childhood. Sincerely, the worst insult to throw to a lady would be to claim that she looks manly. But Williams managed to get over the Wendy Williams born a man rhetoric and ended up an even stronger woman.</p><h2>What illness does Wendy have?</h2><p class=align-left>There has been much talk about the star's medical condition than the insightful show she hosts in recent times. Questions like "What disease does Wendy Williams have in her legs?" have been common, and the star has never hesitated to address it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1dca0d001e7f08c5.jpg><p class=align-left>Wendy suffers from Grave's disease.
