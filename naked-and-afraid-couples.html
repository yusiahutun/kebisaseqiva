Here’s what we know.</p><p>Isolated from the rest of the world for 21 days, sometimes even sharing body heat, most Afraid contestants must crave companionship.</p><p>Apart from that, there is often a sense of sexual tension between the various couples. After all, you’d think that constantly-naked people and more than 122 boy-girl couples equals intimacy, right?</p><p>Sex, like food, water, and shelter, could be considered a basic need for some of. But does anyone actually hook up either on-camera or behind-the-scenes?</p><p>It should be noted that no episode has ever featured two contestants having sex. Channels are required to censor nudity, so this should be obvious. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that such a show would air intimate moments between two people.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe this is what Naked and Afraid of Love was made for instead? After all, <a href=# data-type=post data-id=5243>some sexy hookups</a> did indeed happen on the spin-off.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=do-you-mean-that-the-contestants-do-hook-up-but-we-never-see-it-on-the-screen>Do you mean that the contestants do hook up, but we never see it on the screen?&nbsp;</h2><p>No, as it turns out. There is a good reason why most of the show’s contestants denied taking part in sexual activities during its filming.</p><p>The 2016 <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.glossyfied.com/here-is-what-happened-to-steven-lee-hall-jr-on-naked-and-afraid/>guest star Steven Lee Hall, Jr</a>. explained to EW, “You’re dirty, you’re hungry, and you’re tired. Sex is really the last thing on your mind.”&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel="noopener nofollow">View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel="noopener nofollow">A post shared by Naked & Afraid (@nakedandafraid)</a></p><p>It’s certainly a compelling argument if you consider the danger they’re facing in<a href=# data-type=post data-id=3788> merely surviving</a>. Hall’s views were echoed by fellow participants Alyssa Ballestero and Stacey Lee Osorio. Ballestero said, “The answer is no. That’s not what happens out there. Everyone is dirty and tired; it doesn’t happen.” “You have no libido out there at all. It’s really not a sexual experience,” Osorio explained.</p><p>Hall also noted that he had not experienced any hookups. However, he commented that other participants might be getting it on. Tawny Lynn, who appeared on one of the show’s earlier seasons, said, “Within the ‘Naked and Afraid’ survivalist group, there are rumors about it. I can’t confirm or deny that it does or it doesn’t happen… In my experience, it didn’t.”</p><p>Since the former participants’ statements are similarly ambiguous, the producers have likely instructed those involved to keep the topic a mystery.&nbsp;</p><p>For a reality show to keep the audience interested, rumors are essential. There is no way to confirm it explicitly, but it seems unlikely that people on ‘Naked and Afraid’ have sex with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>In the wilderness, participants face grueling conditions and stern challenges, and hygiene and safety concerns reduce the chances of hookups between them.</p><p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p><p>If Naked and Afraid is meant to test one’s primitive survival skills or to help a stranger find love, one thing is sure: even a deadly snake or getting too many bug bites cannot stop a love connection!</p><p>Interested in participating in the show? <a href=#>Here is how you can apply.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmp5mbmrFurc2dZJqeopa2pXnCqKyppJWofA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnaked-and-afraid-couples.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnaked-and-afraid-couples.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnaked-and-afraid-couples.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnaked-and-afraid-couples.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnaked-and-afraid-couples.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnaked-and-afraid-couples.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./aaron-rodgers-dating-history-shailene-woodley-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./aaron-rodgers-dating-history-shailene-woodley-more.html>Aaron Rodgers' Dating History: Shailene Woodley, More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./prince-william-first-public-engagement-since-kate-middleton-cancer-announcement.html>Prince William Makes First Public Appearance Since Kate Middleton's Cancer News</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./prince-william-first-public-engagement-since-kate-middleton-cancer-announcement.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
