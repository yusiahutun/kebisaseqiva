In as much as the world is getting overly Westernized, modernized, or is it civilized, we all have a social community we identify with. For the preservation of the heritage, native clothing, for instance, is held with a lot of significance. The traditional African wear for couple takes us back to the old days when sewing machines were not there. The cloth would be hand woven and wrapped around the body. The cloth for both the man and woman would be of the same fabric so that it cordially speaks of their unity in love.</p><h3><strong>13. Wrap around African fabric with lace and matching dress with lacey top</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs38ccemduou2g.jpg><p class=align-left>The woman, for instance, can put on a sleeveless dress then wrap the fabric around her body and still achieve the native look in a modern way, and the man can similarly do the same. Although a native look would mean that the look is completely ethnic based, there are some off-beat ways to wear this African couple wear. The hair may be African or one may have the contemporary hairdos. The shoes, again, need not be African, although if you deem it fit, you are then good to go. For the man, the authority walking stick and hat would speak volumes if their desire is to show the world the leadership prowess in him. This style is not only loved for being lined back to our cultural heritage but also for its uniqueness and aesthetics.

For instance, if you are attending a party as a couple, you obviously would dress more playfully than you would have in a religious ceremony. In such cases, you need to check closely the occasion and the ability to accommodate crazy Africa couple wear ideas. Just as the name suggests, the African fashion wear, in this case, is flirty and sexy.

This should be so, especially if a couple is attending a function as a family. In fact, it would appear weird for the kids to wear differently from their parents, unless, of course, they all go for different styles. The family modern African wear does not restrict the family to a certain design or style, although they may choose to slay in the same vein. However, if the parents have different tastes with that of their kids, they may then each go for their designs of preference, so long as the fabric used to make the outfits is similar. For instance, the woman can go for a long maxi dress and the daughter in the picture can wear an African skater dress, all of the same print. The man and, say, a son in the family can wear round neck body fitting shirts with pants of a matching color. This would be a perfect image of African wear.</p><h3><strong>16.
