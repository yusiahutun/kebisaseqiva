There are, in fact, a ton of options to choose from, on a scale ranging from bushy to bare to barely there. But perhaps the most popular styles are your standard bikini wax and your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Brazilian</a>. To learn more about each so that you can decide which is best for you, we tapped a few of the most sought-after aestheticians out there. Not only did they let us in on the differences between a bikini wax vs. Brazilian wax, but they also shared pro waxing tips that will allow you to make the most out of your next grooming session.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for our expert-approved guide to a bikini wax vs. Brazilian wax.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-difference-between-a-brazilian-and-bikini-wax></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the Difference Between a Brazilian and Bikini Wax?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As its name suggests, a regular bikini wax only removes the hair that falls outside the panty line and what would peek out of a regular bikini bottom, explains Gina Patek.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Brazilian wax</a>, on the other hand, goes one step further to remove all hair from the front pubic area, as well as the back, and in between the buttocks to achieve what Patek calls "a completely nude look." However, while a traditional Brazilian wax is hairless, you can still opt for a "neat triangle, strip, or square" design on the front, she adds.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-you-prep-for-a-bikini-or-brazilian-wax></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do You Prep for a Bikini or Brazilian Wax?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The best preparation is to make sure the hair is not short," advises Miranda Boci. "Some clients come in after having shaved two or three days ago, which simply makes it impossible to wax the area." A good rule of thumb is to wait until hair is ¼ inch long — about the length of a sprinkle — to head in for a bikini or Brazilian wax.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As with any waxing appointment, the standard rules still apply with a bikini or Brazilian: steer clear of aspirin the day before your appointment, as it can cause excess bruising. You should also avoid heavy <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>exfoliants</a>, which can leave skin raw and increase sensitivity. However, using a gentle, film-free (meaning it doesn't leave oil or other residue behind) scrub 24 to 48 hours in advance of your appointment helps to remove dead skin cells, advises Hanna Naranjo, and makes the whole process more effective.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-type-of-wax-should-be-used></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Type of Wax Should Be Used?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are two main types of wax: hard and soft, which are sometimes referred to as stripless and strip wax, respectively.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Soft wax is likely what comes to mind when you think of waxing: it is applied to skin in a very thin layer and then removed with a strip of cloth or paper. However, with soft wax, pay close attention to your aesthetician's technique: a new stick should be used every time it is dipped into the warmer — absolutely no double dipping.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hard wax looks a lot like slime and is generously applied to skin in a thick, warm layer and pulled without a strip once it cools and hardens. "Generally, hard wax is better for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sensitive skin</a> and sensitive areas, like underarms and bikini," says Naranjo, who also notes that hard wax is often less painful. "But as always, everyone reacts differently, so we always recommend doing a test patch first to look for sensitivity."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-painful-is-it-going-to-be></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Painful Is It Going to Be?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Real talk: Neither a bikini nor a Brazilian is exactly a walk in the park, but there are a few things you can do to try to get at least a little comfortable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My biggest tip is to try and treat a Brazilian or bikini wax appointment as you would any other ordinary wax appointment," suggests Boci. "I talk a lot and I find that the more I converse with clients, the less on edge they feel. It's all about mentality. If you anticipate a negative or awkward experience, that's what you will likely walk away with. Attitude is key."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Boci also recommends sticking to one waxing specialist and building a rapport, so that after a few appointments, it won't feel quite as awkward to be so... naked. And remember: aestheticians are professionals who have likely done "hundreds or thousands of waxes" says Naranjo. To them, seeing your privates is just another day at the office.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-do-i-need-to-know-about-aftercare></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Do I Need to Know About Aftercare?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>After a Brazilian or bikini wax</a>, you should expect your skin to be a little red and tender for about 24 hours. If you experience discomfort, Naranjo recommends placing a cool compress on the area or applying a bit of aloe, but be sure to stay away from anything with dyes or perfumes. And if your skin tends to be on the sensitive side, take extra precautions and skip the gym, pool, and ocean for about three days, as the friction from the tight clothing can cause irritation.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-long-will-it-take-for-my-hair-to-grow-back></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Long Will It Take for My Hair to Grow Back?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Everyone's growth cycle is different, but most people can go anywhere from three to five weeks before they need to book another appointment. Bonus: getting regular waxes will reduce the amount of hair that comes back, so think of it as short-term pain for long-term gain.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-can-i-do-anything-else-to-slow-down-hair-growth></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Can I Do Anything Else to Slow Down Hair Growth?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Depending on hair type, there are aftercare products that can help to slow down the regrowth of hair between waxes. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Slow It Down Body Lotion</a> ($17) from European Wax Center uses narcissus tazetta bulb extract as its key ingredient, which goes straight to the hair's root to take effect.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for natural hair-reducing solutions, Boci remains a skeptic: "I wish I could say home remedies like applying lemon juice were effective, but to my knowledge, there's no proven way to slow it down," she shares.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs-74051126-7283-4f89-9dff-5515bd74862e></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=46.17296222664><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What's the difference between a Brazilian wax and a Hollywood wax?</span></p><p>A Hollywood wax is actually also known as a full Brazilian wax.

Also, if you're menstruating, you'll need to wear a tampon or a cup to avoid any blood from leaking.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=3 readability=-0.82888888888889><p><span class=accordion__title>How can you prevent ingrown pubic hairs after waxing?</span></p><p>To prevent ingrown hairs, it's recommended to use a mild exfoliate on the pubic area regularly (i.e. once a week) between waxing and post-wax, as well. Glycolic, lactic, and salicylic acids are all chemical exfoliants that are effective, yet gentle enough to not cause any irritation to the sensitive area.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZK%2Bqt8inoGauo2Kvs63ZoqOimZ5ixKLE</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbikini-vs-brazilian-wax.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbikini-vs-brazilian-wax.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbikini-vs-brazilian-wax.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbikini-vs-brazilian-wax.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbikini-vs-brazilian-wax.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbikini-vs-brazilian-wax.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./carlee-russell-charged-faking-abduction-alabama-cops-announce-25-year-olds-arrest-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./carlee-russell-charged-faking-abduction-alabama-cops-announce-25-year-olds-arrest-html.html>Carlee Russell grins in mugshot as she's charged with faking with her own abduction: Spa therapist,</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./arlington-review-enda-walsh-galway-arts-festival.html>Arlington review dance, art and poetry explode in Enda Walsh's brave new world</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./arlington-review-enda-walsh-galway-arts-festival.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
