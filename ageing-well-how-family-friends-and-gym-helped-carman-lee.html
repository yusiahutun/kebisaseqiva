Knowing she had to undergo a two-week quarantine in her hotel room, she came prepared with her gym equipment. Before this lockdown, she visited the gym three to five days a week. But with little else to do in the hotel, she worked out every day – “and the six-pack abs came”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her two-hour gym routines include using weights to work on her abdominal muscles, buttocks, upper arms, back, chest and shoulders.
