If you have really pale and light-colored skin, then light and subtle colors would work best for you. Medium to dark skin tones would require more pigmented colors.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, you need products that will match your skin’s undertone. Here are some shade recommendations for each undertone:</p><p><strong>1. Cool Undertones:</strong> Korean beauty has much in store for people with cool undertones. Look for cool pink, berry, mauve, and plum-colored blushers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Warm Undertones:</strong> Look for cinnamon-spiced, peachy, bronze, and coral pink colors.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Neutral Undertones:</strong> While any undertone would suit this skin tone, choose the pigmentation based on how deep your skin color is.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Skin Type:</strong> Different formulations suit different skin types. And choosing the wrong makeup formulation can worsen the imperfections on your skin. Refer to the following to pick the right Korean blush for your skin type.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Dry to Normal Skin:</strong> Creamy, liquid and stick blushers with emollient properties are ideal for people with dry to normal skin types. These products blend luxuriously and can be easily applied using your fingertips. They give a luminous, dewy look that people with dry skin often crave.</p><p><strong>2. Combination to Oily Skin:</strong> Powder, cream-to-powder, and gel-based blushers with non-comedogenic properties are ideal for people with a combination of normal skin types. These provide a natural, minimalistic and matte finish while absorbing excess oil from your face. They are often lightweight and give an airbrushed look.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> While certain ingredients like talc and mica are often unavoidable in makeup products, avoid ingredients such as parabens, SLS, and SLES as they can be harmful. Look for skin conditioners like caprylyl glycol, panthenol, and glycerin, as well as nourishing agents like fruit extracts, vitamins C and E, aloe extract, green tea extract, jojoba oil, etc.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Application:</strong> If you prioritize convenience, then look for products with hassle-free applications. These could include a cushion/dropper for a liquid blusher, an air puff for a powdered blusher, and a stick/brush for a cream blusher.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Staying Power And Color Pay-off:</strong> Rouges that are highly pigmented are often the ones that last longer. Nonetheless, every product is different and hence, you need to inform yourself about the product’s lasting power, smudge resistance, etc.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to Apply a Korean Blush?</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Prep your face with your base makeup — primer, concealer, and foundation. Or, you can skip this step and apply the blusher directly onto your skin for minimalist makeup. Nonetheless, avoid skipping a primer to keep your skin protected.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If you are using a cream/gel/liquid blush, rub off a small amount or take one drop of the product on your middle and ring finger together. If you are using a powder blush, then rub off some product on a soft, dome-shaped brush or a powder puff.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Gently dab the product in diagonal directions on your cheekbones with your fingertips/applicator. Aim for a natural finish and soften the appearance of any excess pigments on your face.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You can leave it till there or continue applying the product on the tip of your nose, or in a C-shaped motion around your eyes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Even out the product, so it looks like a natural flush instead of blotchy pigmentation. For a cream/gel/liquid blush, you might want to give a finishing touch with a brush despite using your fingers first, depending on your product.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> If you are setting the blush with a loose powder/compact, avoid using a powder puff. Use a thick, soft-bristle makeup brush and apply the powder gently, to avoid smudging the rouge. If you are using a powder blush, then apply it after the loose powder/compact. Set the makeup with a setting spray once everything is done.</p><p>So, there you have it. The above-mentioned products are our recommendations for the best Korean blushes on Amazon.
