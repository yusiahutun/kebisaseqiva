<time>19 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Social media platforms are constantly influencing each other. We see this clearly with every upcoming feature and update. Recently all the social media platforms seem to be under the influence of Clubhouse. To be honest, Clubhouse has created a revolution in social media when it came out as an audio-only app. The popularity of Clubhouse is beyond discussion. It makes easier for users to get involved in real-time discussions while continuing their daily routines in the background. With the participation of high-profile influencers, celebrities and field professionals, Clubhouse had many impacts on the leading social media channels.</p><p>Other social media platforms immediately turned this hype of audio-chat rooms into an opportunity. They organized this feature in accordance with their platforms and gave many Clubhouse alternatives to social media users. Let’s see what those Clubhouse alternatives are!</p><h2>Reddit Talk</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/inflownetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/bcykx1isg5u61-1024x671.png alt width=1024 height=671 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Among Clubhouse-influenced social media platforms, Reddit has become the latest one. On April 19, 2021, Reddit officially announced the new “Reddit Talk” feature. Sharing its first glimpse of this new audio tool, Reddit offers a Clubhouse-like environment within Subreddits. During the test run, only moderators of the communities will be able to start a conversation. During the live conversation any reddit user can join the conversation by raising their hands or they can just react with emojis. Basically, discussions in Subreddits will be able to be carried out through voice rather than text soon.</p><p>If this idea of “Reddit Talk” excites you, you can learn more by clicking <a href=#>here</a> and apply to join Reddit Talk. You can become one of the few “Reddit Talk” test runners.</p><h2>Twitter Spaces</h2><p dir=ltr lang=en>We’re working on something we think you’ll love — Twitter Spaces!</p><p>Still in test mode but rolling out soon. Here’s a peek at what everybody’s talking about… <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/KMXzmKzbDp</a></p><p>— Twitter (@Twitter) <a href=#>March 11, 2021</a></p><p>Another Clubhouse-inspired audio chat feature is Twitter Spaces. Just like other Clubhouse alternatives, a moderator will be able to manage the conversation, allow new speakers to join, or remove someone from the speaking room. “Twitter Spaces” feature is only available to some selected Twitter users for now. And it is expected to be opened to all users after the trial version. The feature was planned to be rolled out till now but Twitter Spaces is postponed due to some changes in format.</p><p>The idea of audio chat rooms may be a new development for Twitter. But in fact, the platform has already been trying sound-based experiments for a while. Twitter launched voice tweets feature a few months ago which allows IOS users to send voice tweets up to 2 minutes and 20 seconds.</p><h2>Instagram Live Rooms</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/inflownetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/154457884_179762646957319_2648717728653332049_n-1024x576.png alt width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>For over a year now, we’ve been living in times when it’s almost impossible to socialize and hang out with friends. The spread of the pandemic has led content creators to try more creative ways to get closer with their audience. One of these creative ways became using the Instagram live feature more actively than ever. With all these Clubhouse-inspired features included in our lives, Instagram decided to double the live experience. Although it is not only sound-based like other Clubhouse alternatives, the atmosphere is the same. Because now more than 2 people can join a live stream which means longer conversations, and more opinions voiced at the same time. Now reaching up to 4 people, Instagram Live definitely creates an atmosphere of real-life hanging out with friends.</p><h2>Facebook</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/inflownetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Live-Audio-Rooms-Rooms-Discovery-Stars-Fundraising-side-by-side-UPDATED-FOR-NRP.png alt width=890 height=593 sizes="(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Facebook is also trying catch up with this Clubhouse-led trend and officially announced the launch of voice chat rooms. The platforms explains why this new feature is a must nowadays by saying:</p><p>&nbsp;Audio seamlessly fits within our busy lives, allows us to be inspired by new ideas, and talk with other like-minded people without pressure. You can share your personal story or join in on a global conversation in any way, anytime, anywhere — even on a bad hair day without any makeup — or in your car or on a run!</p><p>Apart from the other platforms with audio-based features, Facebook seems to find some ways for creators to monetize Live Audio Rooms experience. Audience will be able to donate money while in a live audio room. Apart from donation, some Live Audio Rooms are planned to provide access only through the membership system.</p><h2>LinkedIn Audio Rooms</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/inflownetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Concept-Mock.LinkedIn-743x1536-1-145x300.jpg alt width=266 height=550 sizes="(max-width: 266px) 100vw, 266px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>LinkedIn is another platform that works on its audio rooms. Mostly used to connect with people on a professional level, and build a professional community, the platform aims to increase engagement with audio rooms. Participating in conversations about our interests and careers seems like an appealing experience for most of the LinkedIn users. As LinkedIn isn’t usually the preferred platform for socializing, the platform aims to change this perception and allow users to create wider networks with this new feature.</p><p><strong>As you can see, these Clubhouse alternatives are exactly designed and programmed as Clubhouse. So we can say that it’s influence on social media platforms is huge. May this orientation to audio-chat features be the end of Clubhouse? Or will these Clubhouse alternatives become as successful as Clubhouse did when it first launched? I guess we will see.</strong></p><p><strong>Don’t forget to follow us on our socials to keep updated on social media news and more!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnpu5sMPNnquwp6Kge6S7zGierqGUmnq1u4yco66amKTCtLGMmqOtnaKjrrW11Z6qZqSVqcBus8StZJqknGLBorjKsmY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fguide-to-clubhouse-alternatives-lets-get-all-talky.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fguide-to-clubhouse-alternatives-lets-get-all-talky.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fguide-to-clubhouse-alternatives-lets-get-all-talky.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fguide-to-clubhouse-alternatives-lets-get-all-talky.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fguide-to-clubhouse-alternatives-lets-get-all-talky.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fguide-to-clubhouse-alternatives-lets-get-all-talky.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hailey-bieber-starface-hydro-stars-pimple.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hailey-bieber-starface-hydro-stars-pimple.html>Hailey Bieber Wears Starface Hydro-Stars Pimple Stickers To Clear Her Skin</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dennis-odriscoll.html>Dennis O'Driscoll obituary | Poetry</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dennis-odriscoll.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
