<time>21 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Many are curious about <a href=#>Ryan Seacrest’s </a>girlfriend after this apparent breakup rumor. Seacrest is notoriously private about who he’s dating. That doesn’t mean we couldn’t find some names, though! Here’s what we know.</p><p>The 49-year-old <a href=#>American Idol&nbsp;host</a> has been linked to several women throughout the years, but his relationship with 28-year-old Taylor was by far his longest yet. The pair have dated on-and-off for nearly eight years, having met for the first time in 2013. The TV host and trained chef’s first split came in December 2014, but they were back together again by late 2016. Their second run saw them together again for over three years—during which time they moved from Los Angeles to New York City together. But by 2019, the pair split and reunited for the third time. You can see where this is going.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ryan-seacrest-net-worth.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Mark-Consuelos-Kelly-Ripa-Ryan-Seacrest.png><p>Keep on reading for everything we know about <a href=# id=auto-tag_ryan-seacrest data-tag=ryan-seacrest>Ryan Seacrest</a>‘s girlfriend, along with all the other ladies the on-air personality has split from before (and between) dating his current beau.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-ryan-seacrest-s-girlfriend>Who is Ryan Seacrest’s girlfriend?</h2><p>Meet Ryan Seacrest’s girlfriend and look back at his dating history below.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=aubrey-page-2021-present>Aubrey Page (2021 – present)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ryan-seacrest-aubrey-page.jpg><p>Ryan Seacrest’s current girlfriend is Aubrey Paige. They met on Memorial Day Weekend in the Hamptons New York in 2021.</p><p>“I’m happy. I’m happy in the present moment,” Seacrest said on an episode of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Live with Kelly and Ryan</a>. “I don’t think about anything else. Why push it?” He then added, “I think having kids at the right time would be great.”</p><p>On Seacrest’s last day on Live! With Kelly and Ryan, his girlfriend made a sweet post for his departure. “Ryan,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>never have I ever met a more inspiring man</a>,” the model wrote on Instagram. “You make it look so easy, but the truth is there is just nobody quite like you. I am so beyond proud of you. Not just for your work ethic, but for your caring heart and the genuine love that you give to others.”</p><p>Paige continued: “I am so excited for this next chapter of your life and our life. May it be filled with total presence, joy and relaxation in every single moment. The best is yet to come. Cheers 🥂 Love ya babe.”</p><p>On Christmas 2023, fans noticed that Paige did not post a birthday tribute to her boyfriend, whose birthday is on December 24. She also posted a video featuring her family celebrating Christmas sans Seacrest. “Where’s ry ry?” one commenter posted.</p><p>On Valentine’s Day 2024, she finally made <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">her debut on his Instagram</a> account after three years of keeping their relationship private. “Happy #ValentinesDay @aubreypaige_ , can’t wait to eat that cookie dough with you but first, @disneyparks churros,” he captioned the post.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=shayna-taylor-2013-2020>Shayna Taylor (2013-2020)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Seacrest’s split from Taylor after nearly eight years together came as a shock to many, especially since fans were finally hearing the host open up about his partner. “For the last six months, we both wake up an hour earlier than we used to so we have time together to work out, take a walk, take our time without having to rush,” Seacrest told People recently. “It’s been wonderful.”</p><p>But it looks like this latest split from Taylor could be the last. “Shayna wanted more out of the relationship. It felt like the natural next step for her,” a source told People. “She was ready to get married, but Ryan wasn’t there yet.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=hilary-cruz-june-2015>Hilary Cruz (June 2015)</h2><p>After ending things quickly with Hall, Seacrest was back on the market and dating a former Miss Teen USA by summer. Hilary Cruz reportedly met the host at his 40th birthday party, and the pair kept things casual. “They’re having fun,” a source told&nbsp;People&nbsp;at the time. A little over a year later, however, Seacrest was already back with Taylor.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=renee-hall-march-2015>Renée Hall (March 2015)</h2><p>Seacrest had a short-lived relationship with model Hall for a few months in 2015. At the time, the TV host was on one of his breaks from longtime girlfriend Shayna Taylor. When it came to Hall, a People source revealed at the time that they’d only “gone on a few dates.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=julianne-hough-2010-2013>Julianne Hough (2010-2013)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ryan-seacrest-julianne-hough.jpg><p>Before Shayna Taylor, Seacrest’s most serious—and definitely most public—relationship was with this&nbsp;Dancing With the Stars&nbsp;alum. Hough and Seacrest were together for three years before splitting amicably in 2013.</p><p>A little over a year later, Hough opened up about her past relationship to Redbook. “There was nothing wrong or bad, but there was nothing right,” she told the outlet. “I had one foot out because I didn’t want to get hurt. And I didn’t say what was on my mind because I didn’t want to ruffle any feathers. I needed to be perfect.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=jasmine-waltz-2009>Jasmine Waltz (2009)</h2><p>The&nbsp;Celebrity Big Brother&nbsp;housemate dated Seacrest for a short time after meeting at a lounge in West Hollywood called Guy’s. The pair were reportedly spotted out together at restaurants and bars around town, although sources are not sure about when they finally called it quits.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=sara-jean-underwood-2009>Sara Jean Underwood (2009)</h2><p>The 2007 Playboy Playmate of the Year was rumored to have been dating Seacrest on and off for a couple years beginning in 2009. Though, Underwood has since told radio host Howard Stern that she and Seacrest never actually slept together.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=teri-hatcher-2006>Teri Hatcher (2006)</h2><p>According to the Desperate Housewives&nbsp;star, it only took one date (and one kiss) with Seacrest for this potential relationship to sink. Hatcher told Oprah all about the kiss months after it was photographed by paparazzi. Apparently, Seacrest called her up following their date to say, “I don’t think I can do this with you.”</p><p>“I haven’t seen him since that day,” she told Oprah, before joking about why Seacrest decided not to pursue her. “I don’t know. I ate too much lobster? You’d have to ask him.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=shana-wall-2003-2005>Shana Wall (2003-2005)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ryan-seacrest-shana-wall.jpg><p>Amazing Race actress and model Shana Wall was linked to Seacrest for two years before their split. She even made an appearance with the TV host at the 57th annual Primetime Emmy Awards.</p><p>Years later, the pair were actually spotted out and about together in New York City during one of Seacrest’s breaks from Shayna Taylor in 2016. While it’s not clear if they have simply remained good friends or if there was something more going on there, whatever the case, it was shortlived—Seacrest was back with Taylor again later that year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9kGxqbmppZL%2B6rc1mqp6Zk6eytMCMoKCrpJantqa6w2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fryan-seacrest-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fryan-seacrest-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fryan-seacrest-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fryan-seacrest-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fryan-seacrest-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fryan-seacrest-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./444180-the-best-thing-weve-ever-had-teenage-boy-praises-foster-family.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./444180-the-best-thing-weve-ever-had-teenage-boy-praises-foster-family.html>Best Thing We've Ever Had: Teenage Boy Praises Foster Family During Adoption Hearing</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./roger-rees-dies-veteran-actor-was-71-years-old.html>Roger Rees Dies; Veteran Actor Was 71 Years Old</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./roger-rees-dies-veteran-actor-was-71-years-old.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
