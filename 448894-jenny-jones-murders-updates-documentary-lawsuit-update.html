It was an era plagued by a common theme of shocking TV scenes that seemed to sell quite well. People were obsessed with crazy tales, and hosts would take extreme measures to pull off something phenomenal. However, in 1995, things got out of control when a guest on <i>The Jenny Jones Show</i> took it a notch higher by committing a murder. It is now known as the Jenny Jones murders, still famous more than two decades later. So what went down that caused the bizarre incident?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cc709df06f3e90cb.jpg><p class=align-left>What would you do if you were embarrassed on live TV? Cry, get angry, laugh it off? Of course, the last thing on your mind is killing the person who embarrassed you, but it happened in 1995. Jonathan Schmitz did the unthinkable by shooting his admirer.</p><p class=align-left>The infamous <a href=#>murder case</a> has puzzled many people at the extent of agitation one can have from getting embarrassed on national TV. People are asking right now, "Where is Jonathan Schmitz now from <i>The Jenny Jones Show</i>?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ffeb64753765ffa7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Donnah Winger murder case: What happened to convict Mark Winger?</span></p></a><h2>Appearance on the Jenny Jones Show</h2><p class=align-left>The 90s was a confusing time for TV. It is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hard to categorize</a> programming during the era as it involved violence, sex, profane language and much more negatives that would seem bizarre today. And that is when <i>The Jenny Jones Show</i> was a hit.</p><p class=align-left>It was a plotted talk show hosted by comedian/host/singer Jenny Jones. Also, the television show was produced by Quincy Jones-David Salzman <a href=#>Entertainment</a> and Telepictures Productions.</p><p class=align-left>The show ordinarily tackled unusual subjects that were bringing in high ratings. And they handled things like confronting former bullies, paternity tests, out-of-control teens, people who had crushes on other people and more.</p><p class=align-left>Jonathan Schmitz's acceptance of an invitation to appear on the show was on the premise that a lady had a crush on him. And of course, he went to the show expecting the secret crush to reveal herself. Unfortunately, however, matters didn't go as he envisioned.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8af0af086944015f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of Catfish stars who died and their causes of death</span></p></a><h2>The big betrayal</h2><p class=align-left>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lt. Bruce Naile</a>, when Jonathan arrived at the studio, he saw a lady he knew and thought she might be his secret admirer.</p>He figured she was his secret admirer and walked up and kissed her. But then they told him: 'Oh, no, she's not your secret admirer.'<p class=align-left>The person referred to as his secret admirer was Scott Amedure, a 32-year-old acquittance of Jonathan's. Schmitz knew Scott through a mutual friend, and he was surprised to be informed about him being his crush, which he did not expect. And since he had agreed to do the show, he was unaware of his rights, and he went along with it.</p><p class=align-left>The show's producers stated that they mentioned that his crush might be a man or a woman and was not specific about the gender. Unfortunately, the episode never made it to TV, but an excerpt came out primarily where Jonathan is informed about his gay crush.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ec0b422b381d0076.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Candy Jane Tucker: What you may not know about Steve-O's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In the episode, Jonathan is surprised <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">about the revelation</a> but doesn't appear agitated.

But it happened a few days after taping the TV show.</p><p class=align-left>According to reports, after the TV show, Jonathan went out for a long night of drinking. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">returned home</a> in the morning and noticed a note left by Scott at his door. What later transpired is quite unimaginable.</p><p class=align-left>Jonathan got agitated by the advances, and he immediately withdrew sufficient money to buy a .12 gauge shotgun and went straight to Amedure’s home.</p><p class=align-left>First, he asked Scott if he had written the note left on his door. He affirmed that, indeed, he left the note there. Then, Jonathan returned to his car and contemplated his next move. In a short while, he grabbed his shotgun, went to Amedeur’s home and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shot him twice</a> in the chest before calling 911.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7d408cdf089310d8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Scott on Counting Cars?

And the ensuing trial was as famous as <i>The Jenny Jones Show</i>. It attracted a lot of media attention.</p><p class=align-left>During the trial, Jonathan's defence attorney argued that his client was diagnosed with manic depression and Graves’ disease. He stated that he was pushed to commit homicide because of mental illness and humiliation. The defence attorney used the gay panic defence.</p><p class=align-left>Jonathan was later convicted of second-degree murder in 1996 and was sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison. However, in 1999, Schmitz's conviction was overturned, and he was re-convicted of the same crime.</p><p class=align-left>The fascinating thing about the Jerry Jones murders is that the case was tried twice as Jonathan's lawyers attempted to blame <i>The Jerry Jones Show</i>. But unfortunately, it was not sufficient to keep Jonathan from going to prison.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/56b57511c8b74b1b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 meanest celebrities in real-life according to fans</span></p></a><h2>The Amedure family lawsuit for $25 million</h2><p class=align-left>Another exciting thing about the Jerry Jones murder case is that the deceased's <a href=#>family</a> sued "The Jenny Jones Show for $25 million. They blamed the television show for the death of their son in a civil suit. And it was successful at the beginning as a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Michigan court awarded</a> the family $25 million.</p><p class=align-left>However, the ruling was later overturned after an appeal stating that the show “had no duty to anticipate and prevent the <a href=#>act of murder</a> committed by Schmitz three days after leaving the studio.”</p><h2>Jenny Jones murders documentary on Netflix</h2><p class=align-left>The popular streaming platform <a href=#>Netflix</a> has a documentary series that re-examines Jenny Jones's infamous talk show episode linked to the murder in 1995. It's a true-crime series called <i>Trial by Media</i> and is executive-produced by George Clooney.</p><p class=align-left>The primary interest of the series is to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">examine cases</a> in which intense media interest played a role.

He was released according to the parole he was granted following another hearing.</p><h2>Why did Jenny Jones get cancelled?</h2><p class=align-left>After the murder, <i>The Jenny Jones Show</i> continued to air but was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">eventually cancelled</a> because of poor ratings. It was no longer viable since it was a syndicated show, and it was not getting picked up by numerous markets as expected. The show’s final episode aired in May 2003, after the civil lawsuit was overturned.</p><h2>Is Jenny Jones still alive?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8af0af086944015f.jpeg><p class=align-left>Besides Jenny Jones's opinion about the murder, the biggest question is, "What does Jenny Jones look like now?”</p><p class=align-left>Jenny Jones, the host of the show, is alive and well.

However, the television show ended, and she currently runs Jenny’s Heroes Canada and Jenny’s Heroes California.</p><p class=align-left>Also, people have been wondering about Jenny Jones' children. Does she have any? Unfortunately, she doesn't have children. She is now in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">long term relationship </a>with Dennis McCallion, a film location manager.</p><h2>What does Jenny Jones say about the murder now?</h2><p class=align-left>People have been wondering about Jenny Jones’ opinion about the entire fiasco that resulted in <a href=#>the murder</a>. She is now in the public limelight because of the Netflix documentary.</p><p class=align-left>She still holds that Jonathan was informed that his crush might be a man or a woman, and she reiterated this stance in 1999 when talking to Dateline.</p><p class=align-left>Indeed, the Jenny Jones murders in 1995 baffled many people considering the motive. The killer was released from prison in 2017 and is now probably settled into his new life.
