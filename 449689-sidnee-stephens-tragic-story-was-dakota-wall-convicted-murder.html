She also had accustomed to running away from home and returning on her own. Therefore, when she went missing on July 19th, 2010, her parent thought she had left on her own. However, they feared she could harm herself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/217d70455ed12fe4.png><p class=align-left>When the news of her disappearance became public, the entire community was concerned.

However, Dakota did not like it. As they grew into their teenage years, the rift between them seemed to widen, though they spent time in the same circle.</p><p class=align-left>At some point, Dakota began dating Chad Bennett. He was a leader of a local gang called P-Town Saints. He had a friend called Carl Dane who had dated Sidnee for a while before she ended the relationship.</p><p class=align-left>Sidnee kept the stories of her <a href=#>relationship</a> in a journal.

He would later confess that he had single-handedly strangled Sidnee until she passed out then dragged her to his vehicle, drove her to the bridge and shot her.</p><p class=align-left>The police doubted that he could commit the murder alone and pursued the matter further. They brought in James Glazier, another member of the P-Town Saints. During questioning, he admitted to being part of the crime and implicated a third person, Robbie Mueller.</p><p class=align-left>It emerged that on the evening of July 19th, James Glazier and Carl Dane went into Sidnee's home uninvited.
