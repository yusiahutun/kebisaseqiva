"I was like shoot, I'm gonna get my mustache waxed, get my armpits waxed. Got me a nice little dress."

Haddish exclaimed. "I was doing research, because I'm a scientist. I'm a penialtologist. When I was younger, anytime I would go on a date, I would ask a guy if I could see his penis and then I would pull out my disposable camera and ask can I take a picture of your penis."</p><p>"I'm like, I don't want your face or anything, I just want to remember your penis," she continued. "They'd be holding it in their hands and from their hands you can see, dirty nails, dirty dick. The tip of their penis matched the tip of their fingernails."</p><p>Smith went on to call their penile conversations "fascinating," as Haddish joked, "It's never about the feet, check them hands.

"I made it, this is it, I'm a celebrity now," she exclaimed.</p><p>Then, she thanked the singer for stopping her from confronting the woman who bit her in the face. "She protected me.

She explained that there's "definitely a lot of sexual harassment in comedy because comedians are perverts."</p><p>"I always handled it well though, I always turned it around on them. What a man can't handle is an aggressive woman," she continued. "That scares the f--k out of them. I figured it out early. First they'd be pushing up on me like, 'If you want 5 minutes of stage time you gonna have to give me five minutes. What you gonna do for it?' I'm like, 'I'm not going up my body for no damn stage time.' You gonna make money off me and I'm gonna give up my pussy? Nope!"</p><p>Her advice: "Get aggressive right back. They try to snatch your light man, you can't let them have your light."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f042b0ea-935a-5e51-a7a3-dcb2e05b215f data-container-ref=toofab:article:abcc1503-50c0-5616-9629-04c82255ce97 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6f/5by4/2018/05/17/6f70a654967e576c9782a6a5d6ca5c14_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>Watch Tiffany Haddish Confidently Predict She's 'About to Blow Up' Months Before 'Girls Trip' Fame (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>Making Her Mama Proud</h2><p>Haddish was put into foster care after an accident left her mother with brain damage. "She became very abusive, violent and never came back to being my mom," she explained, saying she entered the system when she was 13.</p><p>The actress noted that some of her earliest positive reinforcement came from her own social worker, who "really noticed I had something" and got her into comedy camp. "I thought I was ugly too. My social worker was like, you beautiful. I was like, you probably say that to all the foster kids so they don't run away."</p><p>Thanks to her recent success, Haddish explained that she got her mother out of a mental institution back in December and hooked her up with the "best doctors" and an apartment in Inglewood.</p><p>"The other day, she was at my house. That was the first time she said she's proud," Haddish continued, tearing up. "It took everything in my heart not to just break down and cry. I went to the backroom, turned on the shower, jumped in that motherf--ker and [mocks sobbing]."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Facebook Video.</p><p>See more "Red Table Talk" breakdowns below!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnl7j29ma21fqbanssCnsGagkZmxqr%2FHZpurmZuaequtw5pkqaGeoLK1wIyspKKsmGK%2FprCMrZibpJViwaK4ymg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftiffany-haddish-drake-jada-pinkett-smith-red-table-talk.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftiffany-haddish-drake-jada-pinkett-smith-red-table-talk.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftiffany-haddish-drake-jada-pinkett-smith-red-table-talk.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftiffany-haddish-drake-jada-pinkett-smith-red-table-talk.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftiffany-haddish-drake-jada-pinkett-smith-red-table-talk.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftiffany-haddish-drake-jada-pinkett-smith-red-table-talk.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./zodiac-sign-beyonce-songs.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./zodiac-sign-beyonce-songs.html>Zodiac Signs as Beyonc SongsWhich Banger Are You?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./woman-world-s-largest-backside-8ft-insists-s-totally-healthy-says-loves-unique-physique-html.html>Mikel Ruffinelli with world's largest backside insists she's totally healthy</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./woman-world-s-largest-backside-8ft-insists-s-totally-healthy-says-loves-unique-physique-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
