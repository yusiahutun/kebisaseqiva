They really liked the concept and promised to bring items to the next Freecycle.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Some folk who’ve not been to a Freecycle before don’t quite get the concept, and ask me what the price is.

Other people snapped them up, but at the same time we found a lot of books that we wanted to read, so we brought them home with us. So much for freeing up more space.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Single-use Covid-19 face masks: good for us, bad for marine life</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the reasons Freecycle runs so seamlessly is that the few rules are straightforward and bound by common sense.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We don’t take broken items, as we’re not a dumping ground for people’s rubbish, and we reserve the right to turn items away,” says Lendrum-Bordoli.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If someone else hasn’t picked up your stuff by the end of the day, it’s not because you’re lacking in taste, but you do have to come and take it home. And of course, nowadays you need to keep your mask on and not go round rubbing shoulders with everyone.”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">One of the great things about Freecycle is that you never know what you’ll come across there.

I also got some fish-skin chips. They were close to their expiry date but I tried them anyway and they turned out to be a really exotic snack.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“South Lantau has a very useful Facebook site for buying, selling and swapping, but sometimes I’m too busy to handle the communications and logistics that it involves. Freecycle is so simple – you just bring your stuff and take what you want. And it’s a great way to give a new lease of life to things you don’t need any more.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aira Fernando, who also lives in Mui Wo, says: “Of course, Freecycle is helping the environment, and it’s free, but on a personal level I’ve found so many things there – water bottles, books, toys, you name it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You also find some really odd things that you need but might not know where to buy, like a big pair of wheels for a trolley that have come in really useful.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another island resident, C.K. Tasioni, who numbers aloe vera plants and antique maps among the treasures she has found at Freecycle, reckons the event and the locale are a natural fit. “This kind of open-source market makes sense for somewhere like Lantau,” she says. “In the city it’s easier to take donations to charity shops, but there’s nowhere like that here on the island.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With Freecycles set to be held roughly every month this year, Lendrum-Bordoli says she’s satisfied with her progress so far.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I always wanted to live in a more circular economy. I don’t like the idea of waste,” she says. “The world is under threat because of climate change and I don’t like the fact that people throw away perfectly good items, especially if they’re perfectly OK to use and your next-door neighbour could be buying exactly the same one.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZMGzrdWeo2aklZ7Atr7EaJirrJmYuaZ7kmppaXFjanynvsSemrKbnJp6psLEp6usZZuasrF51KeumqakmrFutdOepKxln6rBbrjAp5ufoZyhwG64xK2roqaX</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffreecycle-events-keep-unwanted-items-out-landfills-letting.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffreecycle-events-keep-unwanted-items-out-landfills-letting.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffreecycle-events-keep-unwanted-items-out-landfills-letting.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffreecycle-events-keep-unwanted-items-out-landfills-letting.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffreecycle-events-keep-unwanted-items-out-landfills-letting.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffreecycle-events-keep-unwanted-items-out-landfills-letting.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./heartbreak-musics-are-smashing-records.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./heartbreak-musics-are-smashing-records.html>Heartbreak Musics Are Smashing Records</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./artist-snapshot-billie-joe-and-norah-jones.html>ARTIST SNAPSHOT: Billie Joe and Norah Jones</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./artist-snapshot-billie-joe-and-norah-jones.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
