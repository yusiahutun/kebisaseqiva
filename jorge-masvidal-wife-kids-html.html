<time>20 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Colby Covington is very open&nbsp;about his feuds with fellow&nbsp;professional <a href=# rel=follow>mixed martial artist</a>&nbsp;Jorge Masvidal. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In doing so, he spoke with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Mac Life</a> in&nbsp;January 2022 and claimed that Masvidal was hiding and was not willing to fight.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>"He's hiding. So, it's plain and simple [that] he doesn't want to fight [and] he doesn't want to, you know, give the fans what they want," Covington, 34, said. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Later, during the same conversation, the&nbsp;mixed martial artist also slammed&nbsp;Masvidal's personal life, critiquing his relationship with his alleged wife and kids.</p><h2>Colby Covington&nbsp;Claimed Iman Kawa Is Not Jorge Masvidal’s Wife</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>According to various online reports,&nbsp;Masvidal,&nbsp;who currently competes in the Welterweight division for the Ultimate Fighting Championship, is married to&nbsp;Iman Kawa and shares three kids&nbsp;[two daughters and a son] together.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>If you didn't know, Kawa is&nbsp;a Jordanian American entrepreneur and procurement specialist and the sister of MMA agent Malki Kawa. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>But when&nbsp;Covington was asked about the last time he and&nbsp;Masvidal had a conversation, he first shared that he had last seen him more than two and a half years ago.</p><p>"When I was in the locker room and I just beat Rafael dos Anjos for the interim title," he recalled.</p><p>He then exclaimed that Masvidal was jealous of his popularity at the time; and one sudden day, the fellow fighter came to him and reportedly explained to Covington that he wanted to fight for his kids. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>"But I come to find out the guy [Masvidal] is a piece of [expletive]. He doesn't care about his kids," he added.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Not just that,&nbsp;Covington revealed that he had met&nbsp;Masvidal's wife [to be precise: estranged wife] just a day ago, and it was not&nbsp;Kawa. He claimed that the internet was wrong about&nbsp;Kawa being Masvidal's wife and mother of his kids.</p><p>As per him, the mother of the fellow fighter and&nbsp;Masvidal's estranged wife was a woman named&nbsp;Maritza Collado. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Jorge Masvidal Has Not Gone Public with His Wife</h2><p>A quick scroll through his social media accounts and search on the internet shows that&nbsp;Masvidal is a very private man who rarely speaks about his relationships and family.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>However, what the internet report&nbsp;is that he was once together with&nbsp;Kawa, with whom he had three kids.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>A report from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sportskeeda</a> claims that he and Kawa&nbsp;were reportedly dating for ten years. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"There is no information available as to when or why the two parted ways. However, the two are reported to have split sometime around 2019," the report read.</p><p>But again,&nbsp;Masvidal hasn't confirmed his dating or marriage rumors with Kawa so far. He has also stayed silent and made no remarks on&nbsp;Covington's claims.</p><h2>Who Is Maritza Collado?</h2><p>The internet, which is confused with&nbsp;Masvidal's love life details, also shows that he was previously together with Collado.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Colby Covington pictured with Jorge Masvidal's alleged wife Maritza Collado.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>Her name became the talk of the town when&nbsp;Covington mentioned her as&nbsp;Masvidal's wife and even posted a picture with her on January 21, 2022.</p><p>In addition, Covington has <a href=# rel="follow noopener">claimed</a> that Masvidal does not want people to know about Collado. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>If rumors were to be believed, they were married, and are now split up — but there was no media coverage of either instance.</p><p>It is also unknown if she is the mother of&nbsp;Masvidal's three children, since it is unclear if Kawa is his baby mama.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKfp7Smecyaqq%2BhlJa5bsPIn5xmo5mZwG%2B006aj</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjorge-masvidal-wife-kids-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjorge-masvidal-wife-kids-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjorge-masvidal-wife-kids-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjorge-masvidal-wife-kids-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjorge-masvidal-wife-kids-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjorge-masvidal-wife-kids-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./justin-p-wilson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./justin-p-wilson.html>Justin P.
