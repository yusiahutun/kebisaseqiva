The next big revolution that forced businesses to shift was the internet. Today, with the exponential rate at which technology is moving, there is no other option but to adapt to the changes.&nbsp;</p><p>Featuring for The Enterprise World’s this issue of The 5 Best DELL Solution Providers In 2022 is Eastern Computer Exchange Inc., a company dedicated to transforming businesses with innovative solutions.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Company-</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Eastern Computer Exchange, Inc. started in 1990</a> and has grown to a Global IT Solution provider focused on the Cloud and Digital Transformation with Zero Trust Security, albeit on or off-prem or a combination of both.&nbsp;</p><p>“We focus on our customers’ needs by providing the best solutions and technical resources while delivering the lowest total cost of ownership, thereby enabling our clients to compete in the Global Marketplace.”, <strong>Brendan Lynch, CEO, Eastern Computer Exchange</strong></p><p>Eastern Computer Exchange is adept at infrastructure architecture, security, networking and cloud—and most importantly, they pay special focus on understanding their customers’ IT business needs better than anyone. When customers work with the team at Eastern, they get the best choices available from IT industry gold standards like Dell, Cisco, Citrix, Z-Scaler and more.</p><p>After three decades, the company has achieved an unmatched trust from their customers being their strategic partners. From day one, they have had one driving motivator that has consistently guided them: “To put the customers’ needs above our own. “The team has never been driven by what benefits them; it’s all about the customers, and always has been.” Because of this, their customer retention rate is among the highest in the industry. In fact, their first client is still with them today, decades later.</p><p>“Today, our customer line card includes Fortune 500 enterprise brands who continue to turn to us to keep their most critical domestic and global IT operations running smoothly.”</p><p>At Eastern Computer Exchange, the team has built a culture of curiosity and empowerment, and it’s reflected in the everyday behaviors, actions and attitudes of our leadership team, their managers and their employees. It is this mindset that has allowed the company to successfully grow its business while helping customers integrate the finest IT solutions for their own businesses.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Cutting through the Complexities-</h3><p>The marketplace was very different when Eastern Computer Exchange started its business. For example, companies would buy 90 Gigabyte’s storage capacity, in units the size of a refrigerator to run their data centers.&nbsp; Today you get 10 times that on a smart device that fits in your hand. So, the explosive growth they have seen for the last 3 decades has provided the challenges and the opportunities we all have today in this incredible marketplace. Having the resources to cover the opportunity is always the challenge companies need to focus on.</p><p>The Cloud and Digital Transformation was a complete mind shift for how customers view and store their most critical data today. In order to compete with the “up and coming” Cloud based companies, it became critical for brick-and-mortar organizations to evolve and pass their new competition.&nbsp;</p><p>“This allowed us to grow with our customers and provide them with relevant solutions and direction for the changing world of IT.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Products and Services-</h3><p>Eastern Computer Exchange does not focus on products rather solutions that help its customers transform in the Cloud, <a href=#>Digital Transformation</a>, Automation, Managed Services, Edge, Operations, Security and Datacenter space. This is why Dell Technologies has been such a great company to partner with given their #1 leadership position in all these platforms. Like Eastern Computer Exchange, Dell continually evolves to stay ahead of this changing marketplace.&nbsp;</p><p>The team collects requirements, evaluate, assess, design and architect, build business cases and proposals and provide World Class Services to ensure a smooth and successful implementation and turnover for our clients. Their services stand out for the expertise and knowledge Eastern’s teams bring to the table covering global accounts across 5 continents.</p><p>“We have the most highly trained staff with the best OEMs in the industry and over 33 years’ experience delivering these World Class Solutions.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Eastern’s Services Benefitting Businesses-</h3><p>Eastern Computer Exchange’s technical advisory services provide independent and objective recommendations that represent the best interests of our clients’ business.&nbsp;They offer an array of assessment services that deliver valuable insights to technology and business leaders allowing them to make better-informed decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Utilizing this information and leveraging Eastern Computer Exchange’s extensive relationships with major technology vendors, the team is able to provide multiple solutions to improve resiliency, efficiency, and performance while often reducing capital and operational expenses.</p><p>“Since its inception, Eastern Computer Exchange has made a commitment to take a consultative approach with our clients.”</p><p>The team engages with their customers and takes the time to understand their business and work collaboratively to develop solutions that meet their strategic growth initiatives while allowing flexibility and scalability to accommodate unforeseen market changes.</p><p>It is their belief that it is imperative to holistically understand each organizations unique challenges and opportunities in order to develop technology solutions that will meet their future needs in the most cost-effective manner.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brendan Lynch- Leading the Way</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>President and CEO</h3><p>“We have to always stay ahead and up to date with the ever-changing market to ensure our customers have the knowledge of what’s available to help them compete on the world stage.”</p><p>Brendan has 35 years of experience in the IT industry. He started his career with IBM Credit Corporation in 1987, and then opened up Eastern Computer Exchange Inc. in 1990 as the President and CEO. The company has been a partner of Dell/EMC since 1994 as well as being a Cisco Partner since 2011 and now has over 100+ incredible OEMs as the company offers the best of breed solutions to their clientele.&nbsp;</p><p>31 Years in business with some of the best and innovative clients in the world and being able to help in any way has been by far the team’s greatest achievement which they intend to continue for a long time to come.&nbsp; Looking back, Eastern Computer Exchange started selling a storage disk drive in Stamford, Connecticut in 1990 and today are delivering some of the most highly technical Digital Transformation Solutions to the top customers globally, it’s a proud achievement for sure.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZLKiv9Oeqadlk6S6scHTnqlmnaiYtaK6xp5kaw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feastern-computer-exchange-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2feastern-computer-exchange-2.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2feastern-computer-exchange-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2feastern-computer-exchange-2.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feastern-computer-exchange-2.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2feastern-computer-exchange-2.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./pear-eggnog-french-toast.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./pear-eggnog-french-toast.html>How to Make Pear &amp;amp; Eggnog French Toast</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./red-white-blue-nail-designs.html>10 Patriotic Red, White &amp;amp; Blue Nail Designs</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./red-white-blue-nail-designs.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
