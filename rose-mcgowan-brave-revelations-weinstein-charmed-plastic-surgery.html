She described the group as the first (but not the last) cult she has been a part of, comparing the early childhood experience to her time as a Hollywood actress. Looking back, she remembered the cult encouraging sexual relationships between adults and minors, and repeatedly getting beaten by members.</p><p>Once the sexual abuse started, her father fled the cult, leaving her and her mother to fend for themselves. Shortly after, McGowan's father moved on, and she was forced to go back and forth between her cruel father and naive mother. She, too, eventually left and became a homeless teen runaway.</p><p>McGowan began dating a club owner named Brett Canton, who she described as her first love, but he was stabbed to death, which traumatized McGowan. The murder is still unsolved.</p><p>Later on, the actress battled an eating disorder, courtesy of verbal abuse from another boyfriend.</p><p>"I never was able to get below 92 pounds," she wrote. "For some reason, that was my cutoff point. Because I had read about girls who were 84 pounds, I felt like a failure."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:da54a9f3-dd71-5de9-8050-95127a390313 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0b8516f7-4788-52fb-9204-362bd10dbe44 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/49/5by4/2018/01/12/49e2c171e97c59d7913a7dc51d6256c3_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Rose McGowan Targets 'A--hole' James Franco After Critics' Choice Awards Win</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>The Truth About Her Plastic Surgery</h2><p>McGowan debunked previous reports that she had to get reconstructive surgery after getting into a bad car accident -- but also admitted she sparked those false reports.</p><p>McGowan got rhinoplasty in 2007 to resolve her sinus problem, but things took a turn when her surgeon accidentally poked a hole right below her right eye, leaving it to appear slightly pinched. She told the media she had to get the surgery because she was in a bad car accident, but she revealed that was her publicist's idea.</p><p>"I told my publicists what happened and they said to say it was a car accident," she wrote.

The meeting seemed civil at first, but it turned into a nightmare when she tried to leave.</p><p>McGowan wrote that as he was walking her out, he pushed her into his bathroom where he had a hot Jacuzzi waiting.</p><p>"My clothes are getting peeled off me," she wrote. "I back into the wall, but there's nowhere to go."</p><p>She alleged that Weinstein performed oral sex on her while he masturbated.</p><p>"I did what so many who experience trauma do, I disassociated and left me body," she wrote. "Detached from my body, I hover up under the ceiling, watching myself sitting on the edge of the tub, against a wall, held in place by the Monster whose face is between my legs, trapped by a beast. In this tiny room with this huge man, my mind is blank. Wake up Rose; get out of here."</p><p>"Rape to me is any violation of my body," she added.

You want to objectify me? You want to see a body? This is what you want? All you media men, all you photographers, you vultures, this is what you want to see? I'll show you a body.' And so I did," she wrote. "It was, of course, misinterpreted and sexualized, which was the exact opposite point I was trying to make."</p><p>McGowan wrote that her relationship with Manson was actually a breath of fresh air.</p><p>"The truth was that at the same time when he wasn't creating electrifying music, Manson was painting watercolors of my Boston terriers, while I was ordering glassware from Martha Stewart's online store," she wrote.</p><p>The couple ultimately ended their engagement in 2001 because Manson's rock star lifestyle was too much for McGowan.</p><p>"I was really in love with Manson," she wrote.

They quickly fell in love, and he promised to be her savior in Hollywood.</p><p>But that promise didn't last long, as McGowan alleged the director became jealous, manipulative and controlling. She wrote he once believed McGowan was falling in love with "Pulp Fiction" director, <strong><a href=#>Quentin Tarantino</a></strong>. In fact, McGowan wrote the director was so obsessed with her that he shaved his facial hair in the same pattern as actor Freddy Rodriguez so he could replace him in their "Planet Terror" make-out scene. Rodriguez's biggest sin, in her eyes, is selling the movie to Weinstein's company for distribution -- although the filmmaker has previously argued that was always the plan, since he was locked into a first-look deal with Weinstein.</p><p>"I can't tell you what it's like to be sold into the hands of the man who had assaulted me and scarred me for life," McGowan wrote.
