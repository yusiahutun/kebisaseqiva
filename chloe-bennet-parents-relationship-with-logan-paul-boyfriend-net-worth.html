The Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. The actress was born on April 18, 1992, in Chicago, Illinois, as Chloe Wang. Her parents are American, but her father, Bennet Wang, is of Chinese descent, while her mother, Stephanie Crane, is of white descent.</p><p>Bennet grew up in southern Chicago and her home was always full of children of different ethnicities. At the age of twelve, she attended St. Ignatius College Preparatory School and a larger-than-life extroverted Chloe began taking steps towards entertainment and show business in general by joining the Second City Youth Ensemble, hoping to develop her acting and singing talents.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Chloe Bennet Career</strong></h2><p>In 2007, when she was fifteen years old, Chloe Bennet (then Chloe Wang) moved to China on the advice of her then-manager with the aim of exploring the entertainment circuit in Beijing. Her first task during her stay with her grandmother was to learn her mother tongue – Mandarin. She did this in an effort to integrate and gain acceptance in the Chinese market, and it proved to be a wise move.</p><p>She enrolled for courses in Shanghai and soon enough learned enough to sing her first single in Mandarin, entitled “Uh Oh”. The title, which was also released in English and appeared in 2011, was a hit in China. It became very popular and gained traction as it was broadcast by the country’s major media.</p><p>Following the success of the single Uh Oh, in the same year Chloe released a second single called “Every Day in Between”. As her popularity grew, she was given the opportunity to perform at a charity event for the victims of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, and this was her first live performance. Her performance at the Zebra Music Festival was the start of her career in showbiz, and soon Chloe was being celebrated by all the major advertising agencies in China. She was featured in Chinese Cosmopolitan, Vogue, Elle, In Style, and other fashion magazines in the country.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who is Nate Diaz, What is His Net Worth? Height, Family Life, Fighting Career</a></strong></p><p>In an effort to develop a career on the screens, Chloe Bennet returned to the USA in 2010. She was looking for acting roles through auditions but came across a brick wall. According to her, directors looked over her because of her name – Chloe Wang – and since then she has been speaking openly about her perceived racism in Hollywood. However, Chloe decided to drop the family name “Wang” and adopt her father’s first name “Bennet”, which, she claims, cast a spell when she started taking on acting roles.</p><p>She made her acting debut when she appeared in the dance television series “The Nightlife”, which was broadcast on the TeenNick network in 2010 and also featured Nick Cannon. Her next appearance on the big screen was to come two years later when she played a supporting role as Hailey in the television series Nashville. The following year, 2013, Chloe Bennet was featured in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Her character in the series – Daisy “Skye” Johnson/Quake – is one of the main characters in the series, and so she has remained in the series (which had 5 seasons) to this day.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What Is&nbsp;Chloe Bennet’s Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>The Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Star is an aspiring actress who is giving her all to build her burgeoning acting career. Her filmography is almost naked at the moment, but the actress had something to look forward to in her attempt to launch a music career before she switched to acting. Her biggest role in Hollywood so far is her current encounter with the cast of the agents in the S.H.I.E.L.D. series.</p><p>However, various websites have published several estimates of what she believes is the actress’s net worth. The most recent of these (figures for 2018) estimates Chloe Bennet’s net worth at $6.5 million, which she associates with her continued appearance in the series “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Parents</strong></h2><p>Chloe Bennet is born into an American family of mixed origins. She is the only daughter of Bennet Wang and Stephanie Lynn Crane. Her father, Bennet, is an investment banker of Chinese descent and her mother, an internist, is of English, German, Irish and Scottish descent. She is the only girl in the family as her six siblings are all boys. Of her six brothers, three have the same parents as her, while the other three were adopted (one of who is Mexican-Philippine and two are African-American).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Relationship With Logan Paul, Boyfriend</strong></h2><figure id=attachment_34885 class="wp-caption aligncenter amp-wp-inline-086b83d24e4412010a175ea3dba11ca3" aria-describedby=caption-attachment-34885></figure><p>She has only been in Hollywood for less than a decade, but the beautiful actress has already filled her plate with handsome guys. She is definitely not married yet, but she was “busy” on the relationship front. She had her first known relationship in 2011 with actor Tony Oller and in 2012 with Sam Palladio. As if their relationship only lasted a year, that too was over and she moved on with Austin Nichols in 2013. And although this relationship broke the one-year curse, it wasn’t supposed to last forever either, because it ended in 2017.</p><p>Chloe Bennet has been dating YouTube star Logan Paul since 2017. They probably met on the set of Valley Girl, a movie that hasn’t been released yet, and got along well from then on. There were rumors about their separation in 2018 after Chloe deleted all her pictures from her Instagram account. However, Logan had posted a video on Instagram showing him and Chloe on the bed to refute the rumors.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>John Stamos Bio, Wife Or Girlfriend, Net Worth, Kids, Is He Gay</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Chloe Bennet Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>Chloe Bennet can best be described as a beauty to behold. With her tanned long legs and slim build, she is the toast of many men. This explains the many relationships she has had, even though she is not even a decade old in the industry. The actress is 1.50 m tall and weighs 55 kg (121 lb). Her other body measurements are 32-24-34 inches (chest – waist – hip). Her dress size is 4 (US), while her shoe size is 8 (US). She has dark brown hair and also eyes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ksKm4zp5km52eo7K1ec%2BaqZ6mpKh6s7HLmquip56otaq8jLCgraBdobyorc1mp5qtnGKvsMXFq6CeppRiu6bAjLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchloe-bennet-parents-relationship-with-logan-paul-boyfriend-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchloe-bennet-parents-relationship-with-logan-paul-boyfriend-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchloe-bennet-parents-relationship-with-logan-paul-boyfriend-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchloe-bennet-parents-relationship-with-logan-paul-boyfriend-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchloe-bennet-parents-relationship-with-logan-paul-boyfriend-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchloe-bennet-parents-relationship-with-logan-paul-boyfriend-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jason-taylor-and-katina-thomas.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jason-taylor-and-katina-thomas.html>Jason Taylor and Katina Thomas</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./barry-keoghan-and-sabrina-carpenter-fuel-romance-rumors-with-date-night.html>Barry Keoghan And Sabrina Carpenter Fuel Romance Rumors With Pre-Valentine's Day Date Night</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./barry-keoghan-and-sabrina-carpenter-fuel-romance-rumors-with-date-night.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
