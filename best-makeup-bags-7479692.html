You’ve lined them all up across your vanity so beautifully that even a Sephora associate would envy the display.

For those who lack organizational acumen, we did our best Marie Kondo to see which of the buzziest bags out there were actually useful by filling them with bottles of lotions, creams, sprays, brushes, and powders. Then, we pretended each one was a dodgeball and threw them all around our NYC-based lab. The makeup bags who emerged victorious, with the fewest number of spills, breaks, or explosions, were then judged for material quality and compressive ability. Plus, the amount of space it took up in a carry-on bag, design, usefulness of the compartments, and overall capacity. This list is composed of our highest-ranking makeup bags that we’d be happy to take with us for a long weekend or monthslong adventure (we wish!).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-bis-the-cosmetic-case></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Béis The Cosmetic Case</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="B&amp;eacute;is The Cosmetic Case" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/L0TCbbFJM-XbcXCVKsjX-ybQWfQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/beis-the-cosmetic-case-5403f32ac155444c9870e7fd15373a57.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Béis</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It comes with a mirror.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You can’t compartmentalize as much.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Out of all the makeup cases we tested, we found the Béis Cosmetic Case to be the most universally useful. It comes with a removable mirror that’s quite generous in size, unlike some of those itty bitty mirrors you often see that are big enough to reflect one eyelash. That’s definitely not the case here—this one stands upright to give us a view of our entire face so we could do our makeup on the go.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of space, there’s a center section for brushes, which is removable, and we were able to get five brushes in comfortably without flattening the bristles. Then in the main compartment, we were able to fit all of our go-to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>makeup products</a> with ease, never forcing us to leave anything behind for the sake of space. There’s even a shallow zippered section attached to the top lid where we slid in our powder compacts and palettes. Even the hardware holding everything together felt luxe and sturdy, not to mention easy to wipe clean, so we had peace of mind knowing our precious (not to mention expensive) makeup collection was well protected.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also loved how the case opened up completely, putting everything on full display and easy to access. That being said, there weren’t many compartments or straps to organize our products—everything needed to be thrown in together. When we tossed the bag around, the items remained protected and safe without spilling or coming loose, and still, we wish we could compartmentalize a little better.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Faux leather exterior, nylon lining interior<strong> | Compartments</strong>: None <strong>|</strong> <strong>Colors: </strong>10 <strong>|</strong> <strong>Size: </strong>9.5 inches x 4 inches x 7 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-narwey-large-travel-makeup-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Narwey Travel Makeup Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Narwey Large Travel Makeup Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7KCKSFj6G2XpJg84DrS_BudyuFY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/narwey-travel-makeup-bag-large-8fa9149c924844158468d21f0964b1fc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The quality feels much more high-end than what it’s priced at.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish it was slightly more cushioned.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love a good budget option when the product feels much more high-end than what it’s priced at. That’s how we felt about this Narwey makeup case, available on Amazon. The lightweight option doesn’t lack in space, compartments, or even aesthetic appeal, making it a phenomenal option for everyday use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Much like the previous Beis option, this bag opens up fully, giving us complete access to all our goods. On the lid-side of the bag, we could squeeze 20 brushes in the eight brush pockets (ranging in size) — there’s even a flap to cover and protect the brush heads. The bag comes with a fully removable pouch, where we kept our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>face palettes</a>, a color correcting palette, three eyeliners, four lipsticks, a mascara, and a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>lash curler</a>. Then in the main compartment, we stored our foundations, moisturizers, makeup removers, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>favorite dry shampoo</a>, and more. Needless to say, nothing needs to be left behind with this bag, and yet it didn’t feel completely bulky—we were able to store this in our backpack and carry-on cases sans-problem.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If we could tweak just one element, it would be to make the bag more cushioned. Although none of the makeup pieces weathered any damage during our rigorous throw test, we would feel more at ease knowing there was an additional layer of protection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Water-resistant fabric<strong>|&nbsp;Compartments</strong>: 3 <strong>| Colors: </strong>15 <strong>| Size: </strong>9” x 6.7” x 3.5”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hanging-bis-the-hanging-cosmetic-case></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hanging</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Béis Hanging Cosmetic Case</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1118 data-sizes=750px alt="B&amp;eacute;is The Hanging Cosmetic Case" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/NJV3d_F70R8odmV7ECr_SrTWRWE=/fit-in/1500x1118/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/BeisTheHangingCosmeticCase-39571172ff1646efa1d62451cbf492de.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Beis</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There’s a removable pouch, making it easy to take essential items along during day excursions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s very bulky and large, making it harder to pack.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This is for the beauty guru who needs to bring their entire beauty routine with them on the go, even if it means sacrificing a sweater or two in their luggage space. The Beis Hanging Cosmetic Case was truly made for the expert—even professional makeup artists will find great usage out of all the space, compartments, and hanging ability.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We first noticed how the outside has a stiffer material, making it absorb any drops and protecting the contents inside. Meanwhile, the interior is quite slick, so we would have no quarrels giving it a good clean should any powder or creams ever get spilled. The bag flaps open into three sections and has a little hook to hang for when we don’t have any counter space to lay it out flat. Thanks to all the zippers and netted pouches, nothing would fall out while being perfectly visible in its vertical position. We fit absolutely everything we could think of here — moisturizers, creams, foundations, makeup palettes, four eyeliners, five lipsticks and glosses, and still had room to spare. The pouch in the middle is also removable, which we found to be very useful when we wanted to head out for the day and bring a few essentials along.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The biggest con was just how bulky it was. This definitely takes up a good chunk of space, and because of its semi-hard case, we couldn’t quite fold it or squish it down to save space.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Nylon, vegan leather<strong> | Compartments</strong>: 5<strong> | Colors: </strong>2<strong> | Size: </strong>9.75” x 7.25” x 6.5”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-bottles-dagne-dover-mila-toiletry-organizer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Bottles</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dagne Dover Mila Toiletry Organizer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dagne Dover Mila Toiletry Organizer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2KMQSUJ-Pf4fMwUd8-k7dFr0rGw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Dagne-Dover-Mila-Toiletry-Organizer-519c69cdbd9342bcb50f89e495e36e5f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dagne Dover</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It comes with removable dividers to keep bottles cushioned and separated.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish the handle could be opened and closed so that we may loop it on a towel rack and save counter space.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Do you have any delicate perfume bottles, creams, or foundations you want to keep properly cushioned and separated? Then it truly does not get better than (or cuter than) this toiletry organizer from Dagne Dover. The circular and upright bag has a cushioned mesh fabric all throughout the interior, with six adjustable compartments for you to place your individual items in securely.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found that the bag was much more spacious than it first appeared. More than just the six main compartments, we were able to place pencils and brushes (which fit perfectly upright) in the side slits as well. Then on the opening flap, we placed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sunscreens</a>, hair ties, lipsticks, and other miscellaneous items in the zippered mesh bag. Of course, removing the dividers altogether created even more space, but we liked how our glass bottles were protected inside the dividers — not even throwing the bag across the room could affect the interior.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because of the flexible cushiony material, it was easy to squish the bag down and save space in our luggage as well. This could easily fit in a backpack, carry-on, and check-in suitcase all the same. We wish the handle could clasp open and close so that we could hook it on a drying rack at the hotel to save counter space.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Recycled polyester<strong> | Compartments</strong>: 11<strong> | Colors: </strong>4 <strong>| Size: </strong>5.5” x 5.5” x 5.5”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-travel-away-the-cosmetics-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Travel</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Away The Cosmetics Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="AWAY The Cosmetics Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/94ymu2lbQtMuPffpgOZKKyFvuXY=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/AWAY-The-Cosmetics-Bag-ccf1a95daec3490085b0cf2e9f8a0abc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>AWAY</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There is a discreet hidden black pocket for anything you want to keep private.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The makeup brush compartment clips off, but we’re not sure why as it does not conceal an extra compartment or save space this way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A good makeup case for travel should be able to endure the rough handling of TSA, flight turbulence, and rolling over cobblestone streets. For this reason, the hard yet cushioned shell of the Away Cosmetics Bag is ideal. The neoprene exterior felt luscious and high-end, which is very on par with all of Away's products.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We loved the no-fuss simplicity of this option — there is a clear zippered main compartment, and underneath it hides a little black pouch, fit for eyeshadow palettes and medications. The clear compartment is spacious enough to hold just about anything, from creams to lash curlers to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hydrating lipsticks</a>. And because it’s made of plastic, it’s easy to wipe off any potential spills.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On the lid side of the bag is a detachable brush holder with five pockets, although we found we could squeeze at least two brushes in each pocket. We will say, however, that we’re uncertain why they made the brush holder detachable, as it doesn’t conceal anything underneath or even save a bunch of space. The holder alone is of no use without the case either.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Nylon, neoprene <strong>| Compartments</strong>: 3 <strong>| Colors: </strong>2 <strong>| Size: </strong>8.3” x 6.3” x 3.9”<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-large-relavel-travel-makeup-case></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Large</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Relavel Travel Makeup Case</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Relavel Travel Makeup Case" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/IxVuUrDkEeIU_YvjdWk5941FM18=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/relavel-travel-makeup-case-1ffe5ace9a3b4682923a70c43cfdc940.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The internal dividers can be adjusted to your liking.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It's too big to fit into a backpack, and will take a lot of space in a suitcase.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re a professional makeup artist and have to travel to see your clients, then this is the makeup case to opt for. More than just large, this case has been expertly designed with makeup artists in mind, giving us adjustable compartments made of mesh, smooth, and easy-to-clean material.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re somewhat of organizational freaks (Marie Kondo is our saving grace), and we can’t begin to describe how satisfying it is to have our un-shamefully large collection of foundations, eyeshadow palettes, lip kits and more, properly stashed in their own compartments. The brush compartment on the internal divider had scrunch pockets, and the flap that goes over the brushes sufficiently covered all of them for protection. Whatever item of makeup we had, there was a slot for it here, requiring us to leave nothing behind. Thankfully, the bag itself is very lightweight, as the weight of all our products is already heavy enough.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The bag came with an adjustable strap, which we could wear as a crossbody or even turn into a backpack, which makes this one of the most portable cases on the list. That being said, it’s a little too large to comfortably fit into a backpack. It can easily fit into a carry-on or checked luggage but be prepared for it to take up a good chunk of space.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Nylon<strong> | Compartments</strong>: 9<strong> | Colors: </strong>20<strong> | Size: </strong>10.3” x 9” x 3.6”<strong></strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-brushes-relavel-small-makeup-case></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Brushes</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Relavel Small Makeup Case</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Relavel Small Makeup Case" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XFDvhmy2g2NzlfHxFwT5gCOJWUM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/relavel-small-makeup-case-45f0bc70c86140be982478cae63f7f39.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>We could fit at least 15 brushes in the bag.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There is no pouch over the brushes to protect them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">She may have small in the title, but this bag actually fits a ton of product — at least enough for your everyday makeup needs. The most notable feature of this bag however is how many slots there are for brushes. From big to small, there are two walls dedicated to just brushes, easily carrying at least 15 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>makeup brushes in various sizes</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The interior divider features a row of brush holders on one side, and mesh pockets on the other. Once we flipped that over, we were met with a large (but not very deep) space for all of our creams and cases. It could fit plenty of mascaras and lip glosses for everyday wear, but if you wanted to go full glam you may feel it’s not spacious enough. For the average consumer, however, we believe the soft bag is perfectly sufficient for a casual week away.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If there’s one thing we could alter, it would be to add a little flap over the brushes in order to protect them.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Nylon | <strong>Compartments</strong>: 5 <strong>| Colors: </strong>21 | <strong>Size: </strong>8.9” x 5.1” x 5.1”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-small-lululemon-go-getter-pouch></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Small</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lululemon Go Getter Pouch</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lululemon Go Getter Pouch" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bXVfv7BqOTxXG3xnR-GbyZCqnVQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lululemon-go-getter-pouch-3fbc3e84bad94da198133e64040fc5f3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>lululemon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It fits a lot more than it looks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There aren’t any compartments to organize specific items into.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not only is this makeup pouch small, but soft-shelled as well, making it easy to compress for travel. It’s made of the same materials as Lululemon’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>infamous belt bag</a>, which is water-repellent and durable.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The pouch consists of one main compartment, with a mesh interior pocket and an exterior zipped pocket. It didn’t seem like much at first, but once we started placing our foundations, creams, powders, and beyond in it, we realized just how much it could hold, which is a lot (two liters of stuff, to be exact). Thanks to the nylon material, it's easy to clean should anything ever spill — and spill it might, as there isn’t really a hardcover protecting any of the contents. We advise against throwing this against any hard surfaces as the thin pouch didn’t do a great job at protecting our contents (RIP our favorite lipstick cap). This factor simultaneously does make it easier to pack, and should we not want to fill it up all the way, we could press out any air and make it more compact. There aren’t a plethora of compartments, and we did get a little lost trying to find specific items in what feels like a Mary Poppins bag, but we’re happy with how discreetly it can fit a bunch of items in a small size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Recycled polyester, nylon<strong> | Compartments</strong>: 3<strong> | Colors: </strong>3<strong> | Size: </strong>8.7” x 3.3” x 6.3”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-pouch-mz-wallace-mica-cosmetic-case></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Pouch</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>MZ Wallace Mica Cosmetic Case</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="MZ Wallace Mica Cosmetic Case" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/RCcvxThkQ8YVDMjnIM4bXcQYaQo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/MZ-Wallace-Mica-Cosmetic-4407f97b458b45f7977c6e7b3737df48.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>MZ Wallace</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The cushiony exterior kept everything safe and protected.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish there were one or two more compartments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We selected this option as our best pouch pick not because of how much this bag can hold (although that is a big point), but because of its cushiony exterior. Instead of a hard shell, this quilted bag felt like a protective pillow around our valuables, while being flexible enough to press down in our suitcases.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The top zips open almost fully, making it easy to access all of our makeup. There are only two compartments — the main interior and a not so little side zip. We were flabbergasted at just how much could fit into this little black hole: three <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>micellar waters</a>, two travel-size shampoo bottles, a large liquid concealer, a bronzer, five lipsticks, and about seven brushes nestled next to each other, and the bag still didn’t feel like it was filled up. The bag was almost like a flexible fleece jacket to our goodies, easily accommodating our large collection of beauty products without taking too much luggage space.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We only wish there were one or two more compartments in the pouch.

Needless to say, us neat-obsessives had a field day organizing all of our makeup products. And thanks to its large size, we couldn’t imagine a scenario where we wouldn’t be able to fit absolutely all of our makeup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The top lid zips open completely, making it easy to access the various compartments. There were eight brush straps (five smaller and three larger) and a plastic flap to cover the brush heads. For celebrity makeup artist Katie Nova, having such a cover is vital, explaining that ”this separate case prevents bacterial growth, which can lead to skin irritation and inflammation.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Then we were met with two cubes where we separated our toiletries from our makeup products. Around the cubes we still had ample amount of space to store makeup wipes, supplements, eyeshadow palletes and more. When we threw it around, we were surprised to find everything pretty much unshaken on the inside, minus one cap that fell off. The top and the bottom of the bag is pretty solid, but the sides were softer, giving us the best of both worlds in protection and flexibility.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Be mindful that the bag is capital-L-Large.

We tested several, but found this full grain leather option the most practical. While at a first glance it looks like any other spacious rectangular box, a closer look revealed that each of the walls had a different organizational perk. Two sides had a pocket sleeve with an elastic strap, one side had a slip pocket, and the last had a zippered pocket. There was even a mesh zippered pocket on the lid, where we kept eyeshadow palettes and mascaras. We loved how these compartments didn’t take up any additional space (like a divider would), while still giving us the opportunity to organize a little.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The box is quite deep, so even our travel-size shampoos could stand upright. Unless we packed everything snugly side by side, these items would fall to their sides and look a little messy after travel. Not in a way that they would break, but simply look more disheveled than when we first packed it. Should anything spill, however, the water-resistant lining made it very easy to clean. And because the exterior is made of leather, it’s extremely sturdy and high-quality as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Leather, nylon | <strong>Compartments</strong>: 3 |<strong> Colors: </strong>14 | <strong>Size: </strong>7.5” x 5” x 5.2”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-organizer-boacay-hanging-travel-toiletry-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Organizer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Boacay Hanging Travel Toiletry Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Boacay Hanging Travel Toiletry Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Jj670GT7ve0MGpy_H3X_etDr7uM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/boacay-hanging-travel-toiletry-bag-cd84ba475b6c41e9b0992aefd12776a3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The pockets are all clear, giving us good visibility into the interior.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The cover is not that protective or sturdy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s not enough for a bag to have great organizational capabilities, it needs to provide great visibility into our collection of products as well, and this bag does just that. It comes with a little rotating hook, which we used to hang the bag onto a towel rack.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once fully folded open, it reveals four bagged compartments, all made of clear plastic (which by the way is easy to clean). The two center pockets are larger than the outer ones, so we stored our hair spray, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>body lotions</a>, and all other cream products in there. In the smaller pouches we hid our brushes, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>eye creams</a>, and any other miscellaneous items in. We had absolutely no problem storing all of our beauty products, leaving nothing behind. Although it looked stuffed to the brim, once closed it did not bulk up any more than it did while empty. It still folded easily and zippered closed without putting up a fight. Nova stresses how convenient it is to keep all her skincare and beauty products separate, but in the same container, “eliminating the need for a separate bag and simplifying my travel routine further.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we dropped the bag, none of the products broke due to the lightly cushioned exterior. That being said, we’d be apprehensive to do any aggressive tosses of the bag, as it’s not made of any durable or made of a hearty material. Still, with a water-repellent finish and light padding, it’s perfectly usable for everyday use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Brushed, water-repellant <strong>| Compartments</strong>: 5 <strong>| Colors: </strong>8 | <strong>Size: </strong>11.4” x 3.8” x 7.5”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-purses-cuyana-leather-travel-case-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Purses</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cuyana Leather Travel Case Set</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cuyana Leather Travel Case Set" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/mHZJfIf58RInbDCJrIqzi9c22PM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cuyana-leather-travel-case-set-778fc8379060404da59ac149680c56f5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cuyana</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It comes with two bags in one set.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The leather exterior and interior are difficult to clean.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you want to have your beauty items close to you while on the go, then a pouch small enough to fit in your purse is the way to go. This Cuyana set, which yes, comes with two different sized pouches, was quick to steal our hearts with its beautiful pebbled leather design. The bag opened up so wide, it was easy to pack all our essentials in and get quick access to them. The larger pouch has one slit pocket on the side, although we have to admit, it’s more for the aesthetics than any functional purpose. At most, it could fit a single palette (which to be fair, if you pick the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>best eyeshadow palette</a>, that may be plenty.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The second pouch is merely a smaller version of the large one, without the slit interior pocket. At first, we wondered why we would need two of the same bag, but then came to realize how useful it is to keep one in our check-in luggage and the other in our backpacks and close to us on the plane. Together, we could easily bring our entire makeup routine with us wherever we go.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because it’s made of full leather on the exterior and interior, it was difficult to clean the bag. One of our eyeshadow palettes popped open and stained the bag slightly.

This bag is about as sturdy as it gets without having a full-on hardshell makeup case. The leather is strong and sturdy, proving to us it would protect without taking on much damage itself. The zippers glide smoothly all the way around and open in a clam-shell style, which makes it easy to access all of our products in an organized manner.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-93 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The lid portion features four loops for brushes and an elastic pocket to collect the ends. The leather divider in the middle helps to protect the brush heads from the items on the other side, where we placed our foundations, bronzers, blushes, and more. There was even a clippable pouch that we could remove and use on its own on a flight. Because of its sleek and long shape, we placed our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>waterproof mascaras</a>, eyeliners, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>brow products</a> in there.

After honing our selection down to 26 pieces, we called each product into our testing site where our group of beauty editors and experts assessed each individual product. Each case had to hold at least four makeup brushes, two makeup palettes, a bottle of foundation, an eyelash curler, one mascara wand, a lipstick, four toiletry bottles, and a hairspray. All bags that could contain even more were given preferential treatment.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also took note of how many compartments were inside each of the bags, and whether or not they were useful and/or adjustable. We then threw the bag onto the ground to see whether any pieces came undone on the inside or broke on the journey. We then debated whether each bag was travel friendly, fitting into either a backpack, carry-on, and checked suitcase. From there, we selected the best 13 makeup cases that passed all our tests with flying colors.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Size</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Before committing to a makeup case, take a look at your beauty products and consider how much you actually use on a daily basis. Next, consider the location you’re hoping to transport them to, and ask yourself what you need there. The answer to these questions will determine how large your makeup case should be. We tested a range of makeup bags, and found some big enough to suit a professional makeup artist, in need of carrying a bunch of products in various shades (we’re looking at you <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Relavel Travel Makeup Train Case</a>), and simple pouches fit to hold a good chunk of essentials for a weekend getaway (hey <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">MZ Wallace Mica Cosmetic Case</a>).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You also want to consider how you will be transporting your makeup case. Some bags, including the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Leatherology Small Train Case</a>, are too large to fit in a backpack and take a ton of space in a carry-on, but will be great in a larger suitcase.

That being said, harder shells or even cushioned bags take up a lot of space in your luggage, so finding something that compromises between protective yet lightweight can be difficult. Factor in the ability to wash the bag, and it can become downright mathematical. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Beis The Cosmetic Case</a> is made with a vegan leather exterior with a semi-hard lid and bottom. If needed, the sides were flexible enough to be pressed down, so that the bag could decompress inside a suitcase a little. It’s this type of bag that destination bridal makeup artist, Tia Codrington, finds the most useful. “The bag I use has some soft breathable areas and a hard shell in the back to protect the components inside.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Cuyana Travel Case Set</a> features quality leather all throughout the pouch, which certainly helps to protect the interior but is also more difficult to clean.

For everyone else who gets a kick out of neatly separating your liquids from your powders, consider all the organizational capabilities of your future makeup case. Guerra says that a “space for brushes, separate compartments for liquids (to comply with airport regulations), and dividers to stay organized prevent delicate powders or eyeshadow palettes from breaking apart.” So not only do compartments make packing neater, but safer for your goods as well.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The bags that offer phenomenal compartmentalization are the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Cuyana Travel Beauty Case</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Beis The Hanging Cosmetic Case</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Sephora Collection Pack It All Organizer</a>. “Some bags even have removable pouches or adjustable dividers for added safeguarding and flexibility, those are my favorite,” continues Guerra, and we have to agree.

On top of the above mentioned size, material, and compartments, you have to make sure you’re following TSA guidelines — like not including liquids that are more than 3.4 ounces and storing everything inside a clear container, if it’s coming with you in your carry-on luggage. Guerra, who frequently travels to meet his beauty clients, offers a few tips for traveling with makeup: “When flying, I’ll often wrap my powder palettes and compacts in bubble wrap or a small towel to prevent them from breaking en route.” If you’re absolutely worried about anything spilling, Guerra suggests “storing creams and liquids into Ziploc bags before placing them in your makeup case.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Codrington brings up the importance of having clear makeup cases again. Not only “has it helped me with organization, but it’s useful during security checks in the airport because security officers have a clear view of what’s inside the bag without having to go through all your stuff.” And we can all agree, there is nothing more horrifying than watching all the contents of your bag being spewed out by TSA.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is the best professional makeup case?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Professional makeup artists are going to need a lot more space to accommodate their wide range of products and shades. They also require easy access to their products, so bags must open wide or offer a clear case. “I typically go for bags that have a wide opening and transparent compartments.
