After all the others where I started out levelheaded and ended up tossing blame like a tennis ball, I promised myself I wouldn’t lose it. No quarreling, tears, doors slammed. After so much pain, drama, loss and recriminations, I was ready.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She: “You don’t get it.

That kind had played itself out. There would be no more pleading, arguing, threatening. No more appeals to reason, cutting out privileges, giving them back. I had to learn a whole new approach. Because now I knew she was fighting for her life against a chronic brain disease that had hijacked her ability to be rational. Now it was only about her health and quite possibly her life. More than 65,000 young people aged 12 to 25 have died of accidental drug overdoses since 2000, most of which were from opiates, prescription pain pills or, in the case of my daughter, heroin.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I was sitting on our backyard patio that hot summer afternoon. And I was in shock. A few minutes before I’d taken some clean towels to her room and there I saw it: a discarded syringe. It couldn’t be! The bad dream of her addiction was safely in the past. She’d been in recovery for about a year, living several states away where she had a job, was taking classes at a community college, had a support system of recovering addicts, and a nice boyfriend. She’d been through counseling, outpatient and inpatient groups, Medicine Assisted Therapy. I was confident in her ability to come home for a week-long visit. And of course, thrilled. She’d arrived the day before, looking healthier than I’d seen her in years. Earlier, we made pancakes and lingered over coffee to talk about plans.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then she said she had an errand to run. I now know that’s when she scored the heroin.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I got up from my chair and went back inside, where I found her watching television. When I suggested we have a cold drink together outside, she came, reluctantly, hidden behind huge sunglasses. On that beautiful, warm day, we had the conversation.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"I’m humbled by all the mistakes I made, trying to fix her, minimizing the problem because it was too painful to look at."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It didn’t last long. We’d been on this merry-go-round so many times. But I was different. Slowly, I’d come to accept how I could, with the best intentions in the world, end up protecting her disease. Like how I kept bailing her out of trouble (including bailing her out of jail, more than once). But with a good counselor and support from other parents like me, I learned about the chemically distorted brain of someone in the grip of the chronic, progressive brain disease of addiction. Because in short order, the addicted brain needs the drugs with an intensity that wipes out every healthy instinct. And yet, there are cracks in the wall, tiny fissures where hope can have its say. The conversation:</p>Me: "Relapse happens, especially with young people. I know that you’ve relapsed and I’m so very sorry. Because I know how hard you’ve worked to get well."She: {silence}Me: "I know and you know that addiction is a disease. I never told you this, but your great-grandmother was diabetic. Every now and then, she couldn’t resist having a piece of cake or pie. The last time she did, it nearly killed her. So she stopped. And it’s the same thing now with this addiction."She: {silence}Me: "So, you have a choice now. You can give me the rest of the dope, I’ll drive you to a 12-step meeting where you get a temporary sponsor, and agree to go to recovery meetings every day you’re here. Or, you’ll have to find somewhere else to stay. Because I can’t do this anymore. I’m done." She: {brief silence, broken by weeping.} "Okay." Me: {also crying} "I’m so proud to have you as my daughter. You’re smart and funny and talented. This is a blip and I’ll support you every step of the way."She: "Okay."Me: "So let’s go get rid of the dope and find out when the meeting starts."<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s been six years and she has been clean and sober since that day. It could have gone either way, but I wasn’t going to get angry, or try to persuade her. I was simply going to point the way.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I’m boundlessly grateful that she chose to get well, but I’m also humbled by all the mistakes I made, trying to fix her, minimizing the problem because it was too painful to look at. “We have a veil over our eyes when it comes to our children,” a woman with a son in recovery once said. I believe this “veil” is baked into our DNA. But to truly help my addicted daughter, I needed to face the bad dream squarely. Because what I do either helps keep her sick or nudges her towards health. She had to make the decision to get well. I had to learn to let her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Linda Dahl's <a data-external=true href=# rel=nofollow
