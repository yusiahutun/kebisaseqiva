The director, <a href=#>Bob Sweeney</a>, just one day kind of recruited him. Clinton was wearing a cowboy hat and a toy gun. They thought that was a cute character. He became Leon, this kid that was always offering Barney Fife a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>Clint Howard said the ‘Griffith Show’ couldn’t resist having him back</h2><p id=par-6_33>Ron and Clint Howard in 2021 published their joint memoir <a href=#>The Boys</a>, chronicling their years in show business from childhood, and their parents’ roles in helping them navigate and build their acting careers.</p><p id=par-7_69>For his part, Clint still remembers his work as Leon, even at that very tender age, writing: “I picked up my acting chops and on-set savvy by osmosis. My clothing landed me my first job. Dad loved anything to do with the Old West. Knowing this, Mom dressed me up as a toddler in a perfectly sized cowboy getup: hat, kerchief, snap-button western shirt, fringed buckskin jacket, and boots.”</p><p id=par-8_33>Clint observed in his memory of his visits to the Griffith set, “I looked friggin’ adorable.” So adorable, in fact, that as his brother Ron stated, Sweeney found a job for young Clint.</p><p id=par-9_26>“At first I was just an extra, but then the writers developed a running bit for my ‘character,’ such as he was, named Leon,” Clint wrote.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>Playing Leon opened the door to Clint Howard’s acting career</h2><p id=par-10_14>Clint noted that Leon, “like Harpo Marx,” never communicated, not with words at least.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_58>“We never found out who his parents were or if he even had parents,” he continued. “… a generous soul, Leon would come across a grown-up and thrust his sandwich in the adult’s face in a ‘Here, take a bite’ gesture. … Leon’s most common foil was Barney Fife, to whom he offered the sandwich at inopportune moments.</p><p id=par-12_9>“Just like that, I, too, was in the business.”</p><p id=par-13_45>To say Clint has worked prolifically throughout his nearly 60-year career is an understatement. He’s appeared both in his brother’s films including <a href=#>Apollo 13</a> and Cinderella Man, and has also made his own name in the industry, with over 250 acting credits recorded on IMDb.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSwrbXNrWShp6eWv6V5wKebsmWXp7anssitn2armKTEbrzEmqWurF2XwrXAxKtkrJmemcSqr8dmnJqsmaO0bq%2FHmqmam6Sav264zqiinpxdm7%2Bqs8aipWaZlKS%2Foq7LnmWhrJ2hfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fclint-howard-andy-griffith-show-peanut-butter-sandwich-eating-character-looked-friggin-adorable-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fclint-howard-andy-griffith-show-peanut-butter-sandwich-eating-character-looked-friggin-adorable-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fclint-howard-andy-griffith-show-peanut-butter-sandwich-eating-character-looked-friggin-adorable-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fclint-howard-andy-griffith-show-peanut-butter-sandwich-eating-character-looked-friggin-adorable-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fclint-howard-andy-griffith-show-peanut-butter-sandwich-eating-character-looked-friggin-adorable-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fclint-howard-andy-griffith-show-peanut-butter-sandwich-eating-character-looked-friggin-adorable-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rebecca-roiphe-husband-is-rebecca-roiphe-married.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rebecca-roiphe-husband-is-rebecca-roiphe-married.html>Rebecca Roiphe Husband: Is Rebecca Roiphe Married?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./anthony-carrino-wiki-age-married-wife-gay-affair-family-net-worth-html.html>Anthony Carrino Wiki, Age, Married, Wife, Gay, Affair, Family, Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./anthony-carrino-wiki-age-married-wife-gay-affair-family-net-worth-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
