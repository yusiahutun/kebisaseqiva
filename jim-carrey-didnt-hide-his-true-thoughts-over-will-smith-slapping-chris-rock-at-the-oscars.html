<time>01 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>After the infamous Oscars slap, comedian and actor Jim Carrey</strong> <strong>was honest about how he felt about the moment that sent shockwaves around the globe. It was called the slap that was ‘heard around the world’, and it was right.</strong></p><p>The Mask star, who himself has never been nominated for an Academy Award, was being interviewed by CBS Mornings’ Gayle King after the incident when the conversation turned to the infamous confrontation live on stage. Jim shared his thoughts on <a href=#>Will Smith</a> slapping that year’s host, Chris Rock. He also shared how he felt when it came to Will receiving Best Actor at the <a href=#>awards show</a> and the standing ovation he was given by those in attendance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jim-carrey-was-sickened-by-the-oscars-slap>Jim Carrey was ‘sickened’ by the Oscars slap</h2><p>Jim Carrey said he believed the Oscars slap had an impact on everyone in <a href=#>Hollywood</a> and how the general public viewed the film industry’s biggest stars. He also said he couldn’t believe A-listers gave Will a standing ovation when he won the Best Actor award for King Richard minutes later.</p><p>“I was sickened,” the 62-year-old said. “I was sickened by the standing ovation. Hollywood is just spineless en masse and it really felt like this is a really clear indication that we aren’t the cool club anymore.”</p><p>He added he believed Will should’ve been escorted out of the venue afterward.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan ‘hurt’ by joke at her expense in new Mean Girls movie</a></p><p>When the <a href=#>TV</a> host pointed out Chris, 58 had declined to press charges against Will, 55, Jim said he would’ve done so if he was in that position. He claimed Chris hadn’t done so because he “didn’t want the hassle.”</p><p>“I’d have announced this morning that I was suing Will for $200 million because that video is going to be there forever, it’s going to be ubiquitous. That insult is gonna last a very long time. If you want to yell from the audience and show disapproval or say something on Twitter [that’s fine].</p><p>“But you do not have the right to walk up on stage and smack somebody in the face because they said words.”</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> concluded: “[The slap] came out of nowhere because Will has something going on inside him that’s frustrated. I wish him the best. I have nothing against Will Smith. He’s done great things, but that was not a good moment. It cast a shadow over everyone’s shining moment last night… It was a selfish moment.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-led-to-the-oscars-slap>What led to the Oscars slap?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1388085428-1024x734.jpg><p>Jim Carrey delivered his verdict on the <a href=#>Oscars</a> slap, which occurred during the 2022 ceremony. It came after Chris told a joke about <a href=#>Jada Pinkett Smith, Will’s wife</a>. He was presenting the Best Documentary Feature Film award when he made a joke about Jada’s head. The star had shaved her hair in 2022 after being diagnosed with alopecia.</p><p>“Jada, I love you. Can’t wait for ‘G.I. Jane 2,” Chris said. He was referencing the similarities of The Matrix actress and Demi Moore’s character in the 1997 action film, who shaves her head.</p><p>Will then walked up to the stage and slapped Chris before returning to his seat. He shouted more than once: “Keep my wife’s name out your f****** mouth.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-smith-was-embarrassed-by-the-incident>Will Smith was ’embarrassed’ by the incident</h2><p>A day after the awards, Will, took to his <a href=#>Instagram</a> to apologize to Chris. In part, the <a href=#>movie</a> actor wrote: “Violence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive. My behavior at last night’s Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable. Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada’s medical condition was too much for me to bear, and I reacted emotionally.</p><p>“I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris.&nbsp;I was out of line, and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.”</p><p>Jada, 52, also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> last year Chris had apologized to her for the joke.</p><p>“Chris came down to the end of the stage and tried to apologize to me,” Jada said. “He said, ‘I didn’t mean you any harm.’ I said, ‘I can’t talk about this now, Chris.'”</p><p>She added: “No, I haven’t talked to Chris [since]. [Do I have] any desire to talk to Chris? Here’s my desire: I just hope that all the misunderstanding around this can be cleared up and that there can be peace.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Jim Carrey would stare at himself in the mirror for hours whilst growing up</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2WGcLbIpmScmaKnsrp5w6Kbp6xdnbalsYyhoKxlpKfCpnnToaaun5ipwG671Z6pZq%2BZobluv8yiq6Flo6GusbzIp55mm5intrR50aiapGWRqXq1tMRmpqybkafAcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjim-carrey-didnt-hide-his-true-thoughts-over-will-smith-slapping-chris-rock-at-the-oscars.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjim-carrey-didnt-hide-his-true-thoughts-over-will-smith-slapping-chris-rock-at-the-oscars.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjim-carrey-didnt-hide-his-true-thoughts-over-will-smith-slapping-chris-rock-at-the-oscars.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjim-carrey-didnt-hide-his-true-thoughts-over-will-smith-slapping-chris-rock-at-the-oscars.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjim-carrey-didnt-hide-his-true-thoughts-over-will-smith-slapping-chris-rock-at-the-oscars.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjim-carrey-didnt-hide-his-true-thoughts-over-will-smith-slapping-chris-rock-at-the-oscars.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./megan-moroney-stepped-on-miranda-lambert.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./megan-moroney-stepped-on-miranda-lambert.html>Megan Moroney Accidentally Stepped on Miranda Lambert</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./filipino-actress-heart-evangelista-expecting-baby-boy-and-baby.html>Filipino actress Heart Evangelista says a baby boy and a baby girl are waiting for her after d</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./filipino-actress-heart-evangelista-expecting-baby-boy-and-baby.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
