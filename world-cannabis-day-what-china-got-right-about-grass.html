In recent years, there has been a sea change in public attitudes towards cannabis in the West. More and more countries have legalised or decriminalised the recreational use of marijuana.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Recreational marijuana sales get green light in Canada, as report endorses legalisation plans</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ironically, in Asia where cannabis cultivation first began, cannabis laws remain the strictest. China will probably be the last country to relax such laws because of its painful history with drug use. But even here, the story is not straightforward. China is by far the world’s largest cultivator of industrial cannabis, or hemp, and a leading researcher on the medicinal use of cannabis, accounting for more than half of the patents filed globally last year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Let’s go back to the evolution of marijuana in America for a minute.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Few policies have backfired as spectacularly as the White House’s war on cannabis in the 1980s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/21/bd384c90-24ed-11e7-a553-18fc4dcb5811_1320x770_092411.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Smoking marijuana was always illegal in the US, but the law was loosely implemented throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Cannabis culture spread fast and wide thanks to the hippie movement and was on the verge of social acceptance. In 1972, US president Jimmy Carter even proposed to decriminalise marijuana. His point man on drug policy, Peter Bourne, openly smoked it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Things took a sudden turn when Ronald Reagan came to power. Reagan and his wife Nancy crusaded passionately against marijuana, making it the focal point of America’s war on drugs. Marijuana was listed together with heroin and cocaine as the most dangerous drugs – even though there was no evidence suggesting that its effect could be anywhere as hazardous as the other two.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To this day, there is no single proven case of death caused by marijuana overdose. The drug dependency rate of marijuana is low. Only 9 per cent of marijuana users will develop withdrawal syndromes after they quit, on par with caffeine. By comparison, the dependency rate for tobacco is 32 per cent, alcohol 15 per cent and cocaine 17 per cent, according to a study by the US National Institute on Drug Abuse based on samples of 8,000 people.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet throughout the 1980s till 2000, the lion share of the US government’s anti-drug efforts was spent on battling marijuana use. Nearly 50,000 American citizens were jailed solely for marijuana-related crimes – higher than any other drug offence. Doctors were told they could not even talk about the potential medicinal use of the plant. Today, many are still puzzled by the intensity and single-mindedness in demonising cannabis. Some believe that its close identification with the hippie culture made it a trophy target for political conservatives who resented against the liberal 1960s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/21/6f8395d6-2583-11e7-a553-18fc4dcb5811_1320x770_092411.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Before 1981, most of the marijuana smoked in America was grown in Mexico. These were seeds of cannabis sativa, an equatorial species that could not set flowers north of the 30th parallel, meaning that it was difficult to grow in most parts of the US. Reagan’s war on marijuana, and Mexican drug cartels’ discovery that cocaine and heroin had much higher profit margins, stopped the flow of marijuana across the border.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Thousands of American hippies embarked on the “hashish quest” through Asia to search for a type of cannabis that would flower farther north. My first encounter with an American was a by-product of this big adventure.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Rule number one of marketing marijuana: Avoid stoner clichés</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Eventually they found their holy grail in Afghanistan and returned with seeds of cannabis indica – a stout, frost-tolerant species that can flower as far north as Alaska. The indica is exceptionally potent, although its taste is harsher and its highs more physically debilitating than those of sativa. Many growers soon started crossing the two in the hope of producing something that would combine the most desirable traits of each plant. The result was a great revolution in cannabis genetics.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The new sativa/indica hybrids have the smoother taste associated with the best sativa and the powerful potency and hardiness of an indica. Today, these hybrids – including Northern Lights, Skunk #1, Purple Haze, California Orange and Pineapple Express – are regarded as the benchmarks of modern marijuana breeding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/21/63c30be6-2583-11e7-a553-18fc4dcb5811_1320x770_092411.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite the sweeping ban by Reagan’s government, the growth of the plant expanded in the US. In 1982, the White House was embarrassed to find that the amount of domestic marijuana was bigger than its official estimate of total American crops. The US government began to fly aerial reconnaissance missions to spot marijuana farms. This forced the growers to move indoors. There, they kick-started a second revolution in cannabis genetics.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By growing cannabis in greenhouses, growers could precisely manipulate water, nutrients, light, carbon dioxide and heat. This made it possible to produce “Frankenstein” species that are small in stature but have extremely high yield and potency. The concentration of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principle psychoactive compound in marijuana, ranged from 2 per cent to 3 per cent before the crackdown in 1980s. Most of the natural cannabis species found in Yunnan, for instance, has a THC level between 1.5 per cent and 3 per cent. But in the greenhouses, growers started breeding marijuana with THC levels above 15 per cent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/21/7629d47c-2583-11e7-a553-18fc4dcb5811_1320x770_092411.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nowadays, THC levels in the range of 30 per cent are not unheard of. The China Yunnan, an indica-dominant hybrid strain, boasts a THC level of 15 to 19 per cent. It is much more potent and powerful than its natural ancestors. By 1987, all these various techniques had evolved into a state-of-the-art indoor growing regimen that came to be known as the Sea of Green (SOG). Today SOG has become the “industrial standard” for marijuana growers around the world.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Instead of ridding the world of a mild psychoactive plant that has been used by humans for thousands of years, Reagan’s war on marijuana became the greatest catalyst in the plant’s history and gave birth to the modern marijuana industry. Ironically, as American states now begin to legalise pot, the plant has been made much more potent and powerful since the crackdown.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These developments also shaped the plant’s story in Asia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For millennia, cannabis has been an integral part of Chinese agriculture. One of the earliest written records of cannabis cultivation was found in China, written on turtle shells about 4,744 years ago. Its cultivation began at least 1,000 years earlier. Most of the Chinese cannabis, or hemp, belonged to a sativa strain low in THC – under 1 per cent. It was one of the five major agricultural crops – together with millet, sorghum, beans and rice – in ancient China.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/21/a846d000-24ec-11e7-a553-18fc4dcb5811_1320x770_092411.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hemp produces strong fibers that are ideal for textile, rope and paper making. Some sativa strains, particularly those from Yunnan and Guangxi, have stronger THC. These are widely used as medicinal herbs. Entries of medical lore on cannabis are found in ancient text like Pen T’sao Ching – an influential Chinese pharmacopoeia written 1,800 years ago. It states that cannabis seeds have wonderful effects on curing many diseases such as dementia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Because of the opium war, “dupin (poisonous stuff)” is stigmatised in modern Chinese culture. It is associated with national humiliation and foreign aggression. Chinese authorities and society took a very stern view on the use of dupin. But since cannabis was seldom used for recreational purposes in China, it was initially not considered a drug. Cannabis farms were particularly commonplace in Yunnan and Guangxi. While most of these grew industrial hemp, many ethnic minorities did include the more potent sativa strains in their diet. It was also widely used in their religious practices, with some believing it could give the power of divination when used together with ginseng.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">The brain and marijuana: Chinese and US researchers uncover ‘perfect fit’ behind the buzz</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1985, China became a signatory of the International Drug Control Conventions. Under the heavy influence of the US, cannabis was included as one of the major banned plants. The Chinese government followed suit and started to crack down on marijuana. This caused a lot of confusion and even conflicts. In Yunnan, the provincial government initially confused drug cannabis with industrial hemp (technically, they do belong to the same species). Until the late 1990s, the growing of cannabis for any reason was prohibited. Many local farms and ethnic minorities bitterly complained about the blanket ban. Meanwhile, cannabis – wild or cultivated – continued to flourish in most parts of the province.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese authorities soon realised that for the prohibition to work, they needed to “separate gold from sand”. In the late 1990s, the provincial government began to allow cannabis (hemp) cultivation. All the seeds had to be approved by the provincial academy of agricultural science. These seeds were genetically selected for low THC (below 0.3 per cent). In 2001, the government started to actively promote cannabis cultivation. To avoid confusion, the cannabis was renamed from “dama” to “huoma”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/21/e8d413a8-24ec-11e7-a553-18fc4dcb5811_1320x770_092411.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Today, cannabis has become a multibillion-dollar industry in Yunnan. Cannabis farms spread to 13 prefectures and 38 counties throughout the province, producing more than 50,000 tonnes of sativa seeds annually. In 2012, industrial cannabis was listed as a priority project by the provincial government. The authorities even set up a 10-billion-yuan (HK$11.3 billion) industrial cannabis fund for research and promotion. Yunnan now boasts the world’s largest cultivation of industrial cannabis (hemp).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unlike in the US or Japan, China did not ban research on cannabis for medical purposes. Of the 606 cannabis-related patents filed worldwide, China accounts for 309 of them. One key compound in cannabis is cannabidiol – proven to be effective in curing dementia, seizures, depression and Parkinson’s disease.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Exacting pure cannabidiol from cannabis is extremely difficult, as it is often mixed with THC. In 2014, Chinese researchers in Yunnan successfully achieved high-purity cannabidiol exaction (95 per cent) from sativa seeds. It has built the world’s first and only industrial centre to produce cannabidiol in large quantities. In 2015, China began to export cannabidiol to Europe.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even the military began to take interests in cannabis. There are reports of military-related pharmaceuticals experimenting with cannabis extracts to produce drugs that could help soldiers “to overcome battlefield anxiety and depression”. Industrial insiders estimated that the cannabis industry would grow into a trillion-dollar business in the next decade.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The success story of Yunnan did not get lost on its neighbours. In December last year, the Thai government announced that it would allow six provinces in the north to grow industrial cannabis, copying the Yunnan model.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are few if any plants that have undergone a more drastic genetic evolution as cannabis in modern history. For good and bad, seems certain to remain with us for centuries to come. <span class="tw_sectioncolor css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1><span class="courier css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>■</span></span></p><p datatype="p" class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101229113574VgF data-qa=Component-Component>Continued on p.10</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Continued from p.9</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZMCwr8ieq7JnkafBqq%2FLnmZraGhufnh9jrCmq6SUYrCius2amaKrXZmuunnWoZitZZOdtq%2BtjKCmrWWinrSpwIyamaitpGK0s63SrA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fworld-cannabis-day-what-china-got-right-about-grass.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fworld-cannabis-day-what-china-got-right-about-grass.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fworld-cannabis-day-what-china-got-right-about-grass.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fworld-cannabis-day-what-china-got-right-about-grass.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fworld-cannabis-day-what-china-got-right-about-grass.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fworld-cannabis-day-what-china-got-right-about-grass.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./best-electric-razor-for-women.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./best-electric-razor-for-women.html>12 Best Electric Razors for Women in 2024, According to Experts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./janet-jacksons-fashion-evolution-sexy-siren-style-icon-she-showed-skin-90s-sex-symbol-and-married.html>Janet Jacksons fashion evolution from sexy siren to style icon: she showed off skin as a 90s sex</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./janet-jacksons-fashion-evolution-sexy-siren-style-icon-she-showed-skin-90s-sex-symbol-and-married.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
