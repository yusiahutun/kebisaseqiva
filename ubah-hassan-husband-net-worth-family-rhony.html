She definitely deserves to be on </span><i><span>Real Housewives of New York City </span></i><span>season 14.</span></p><p><span>But who is this real housewife’s husband and family? What’s her net worth? Find answers as this article proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Ubah Hassan On RHONY</b></h3><p><span>Bravo’s brand-new cast for the rebooted </span><i><span>Real Housewives of New York City</span></i><span> franchise (set to premiere in 2023) is here. And our star, Ubah Hassan is one of them.</span></p><p><span>The cast was first announced at a </span><i><span>Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen </span></i><span>taping during BravoCon, where the ladies also surprised fans by walking on stage.</span></p><p><span>According to its executive producer Andy Cohen, Bravo (this season) was looking for a cast that better reflected New York City. It will follow “an all-new group of seven dynamic women who run in the same social circles, thriving in one of the most diverse and electric cities in the world. From fashion and real estate to philanthropy and social influence, these women have made their mark in NYC and will now share their lives as they juggle careers, family life, and jam-packed social calendars in the city that never sleeps.”</span></p><p><span>Guess the show will be as interesting as ever.</span></p><p><span>Also, it was rumored that the legacy version of </span><i><span>RHONY</span></i><span> was already fully cast (that included Dorinda Medley and Sonja Morgan), and deals were in the process of closing. However, when asked about the details, Dorinda played coy, “I swear to you, you know as much as we do. I promise you. I’ve heard more about the new girls [on the rebooted ‘RHONY’] than I have about ‘Legacy.’ Listen, if you hear something, call me! I’ll be at Blue Stone Manor waiting, decorating for Halloween.”</span></p><p><span>Joining Ubah for the 14th installment of </span><i><span>RHONY</span></i><span> were her co-stars — Sai De Silva, Erin Lichy, Jenna Lyons, Lizzy Savetsky, Jessel Taank, and Brynn Whitfield.</span></p><p><i><span>RHONY</span></i><span> is produced by Shed Media with Shannon, Lauren Volonakis, and Glenda Cox serving as executive producers.</span></p><h3><b>Ubah Hassan Husband</b></h3><p><span>Ubah Hassan didn’t mention she had a husband. But she did talk about her dating life in an interview.</span></p><p><span>According to the star, she’s so tall that no men want to talk to her. “And I love that. I think, just don’t come near me. And I can’t dance if I’m not wearing heels,” she said. However, if you’re trying to approach the lady, she has one piece of advice for you “be a gentleman” — introduce yourself properly to everyone, don’t make small chat, rather get straight to the point (and drop ur name and number).</span></p><p><span>“Guys in America, they don’t know how to (approach a girl). Chasing a girl, for them — calling a girl, asking her out — is a form of weakness. Which is like the opposite. Only a man would go with that they want,” she added.</span></p><p><span>Now, talking about her past dating life, she seemed to have a boyfriend in 2021. He even helped her with her business — boxing the orders.</span></p><p><span>Back in 2014, the </span><i><span>RHONY</span></i><span> star was also rumored to be dating the music mogul Jason Flom, owner of </span><i><span>Lava Record</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Ubah Hassan Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Ubah Hassan garnered a net worth of above $700 thousand by 2022.</span></p><p><span>This beauty started her career in modeling at the age of 17 after being spotted by a photographer in Vancouver. Soon signed to </span><i><span>Click Model Management</span></i><span> in New York, Ubah then went on to be the face of Ralph Lauren’s s/s 09 campaign, and also got the chance to walk the runway for Ralph Lauren, Oscar de la Renta, and Betsey Johnson</span></p><p><span>However, it wasn’t until she was photographed by Steven Meisel for the black issue of Italian Vogue that Ubah climbed the spotlight. In a time when people weren’t hiring black models, Ubah majorly change the tradition.</span></p><p><span>Thereafter, Uba ventured into the business of selling hot sauce, titled </span><i><span>Ubah Hot</span></i><span>. And fortunately, Oprah Winfrey loved it and added the sauce to her “Oprah’s Favorite Things” list.</span></p><p><span>“I felt like I had won the Oscar for small business entrepreneurs,”&nbsp; Ubah recalled the moment.</span></p><p><span>Naturally, the star then got flooded with orders and called all her friends to help her. “We were packing 36 to 40 boxes in minutes. If Elon Musk saw us in this warehouse and how fast and efficient we were working, he wouldn’t need to create robots,” she joked.</span></p><p><span>Here’s </span><i><span>Ubah Hot</span></i><span>’s IG @</span><a href=#><span>ubahhot</span></a><span>.

She and her family had to flee from war-torn Somalia to Kenya, and ultimately to Canada. And as tragic as it may sound, Ubah and her father were separated for 7 years from her mother and brother who went to Ethiopia.</span></p><p><span>And this is also the reason, Ubah finds time for philanthropic work in her bust schedule. She worked closely with </span><i><span>TOMS global charity.</span></i></p><p><span>It was also reported that Ubah has two sisters.</span></p><p><b>Trivia:</b><span> Ubah claims that her mom makes the best food.
