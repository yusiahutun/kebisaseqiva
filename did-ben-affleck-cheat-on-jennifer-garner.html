Jennifer became a huge celebrity. She became a&nbsp;huge star, and she deserved everything she got. There was no other relationship; there was no infidelity, nothing. People get divorced, you know?”</p><p>A year later, it was Affleck and Lopez who had split.&nbsp;</p><p>In a recent interview with Vanity Fair, Lopez stated, ” I lost regard for myself, questioned whether I belonged in the business, thought maybe I sucked at everything.” Lopez later married Mark Anthony. A union that ultimately <a href=#>failed as well</a>.</p><p>Affleck and Garner were first photographed together at the World Series in 2004 when the Boston Red Sox were playing.</p><p>After the World Series games that cemented their relationship, Us Weekly reported Garner went to visit Affleck in Vancouver while he was filming “Man About Town.” The two were photographed together walking in the rain.</p><p>After months of mostly keeping their&nbsp;relationship private, Affleck proposed to Garner on her 33rd birthday, according to People.</p><p>Garner and Affleck have three&nbsp;children&nbsp;together: two daughters, Violet Ann Affleck, born in 2005, and Seraphine Rose Elizabeth Affleck, born in 2009, as well as a son, Samuel Garner Affleck, born in 2012.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who did Ben Affleck cheat on Jennifer Garner with?</h2><p>When still married to Garner, Affleck began secretly dating a 38-year-old “Saturday Night Live” producer named Shookus. Garner’s discovery of Affleck’s affair with Shookus led to the end of their 10-year marriage.</p><p>In July of 2015, Us Weekly broke the story alleging that Ben Affleck had been involved in an extramarital affair with his children’s nanny, Christine Ouzounian, citing anonymous&nbsp;sources.</p><p>A source close to Ouzounian claimed that she belonged to a high-end nanny firm based in&nbsp;Beverly Hills&nbsp;and was hired while the married couple was already in the midst of a hush-hush, 10-month-long trial separation.&nbsp;</p><p id=ent-30>Not long into Ouzounian’s employment, however, sparks started flying between the recent college grad and Affleck. “They would hang out without the kids. And they were very flirty,” the&nbsp;source&nbsp;disclosed.</p><p id=ent-30>That source also maintained that Garner immediately let Ouzounian go the moment she found out that her husband’s&nbsp;relationship&nbsp;with the&nbsp;family nanny&nbsp;was anything other than strictly professional.&nbsp;</p><p>A&nbsp;source&nbsp;claimed Ouzounian’s firing did absolutely nothing to quash their relationship. Instead, the star-crossed lovers still found ways to communicate with one another. “She says Ben really, really likes her,” the anonymous insider divulged. “She’s saying this is true love.”</p><p>Affleck’s camp, however, vehemently denied everything. “All allegations of a romantic&nbsp;relationship&nbsp;are baseless,” a rep for the actor swiftly stated in an interview with Us Weekly.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Divorce</h2><p id=ent-36>Soon after the report about the nanny emerged, Affleck and Garner released a joint statement about their&nbsp;divorce to People&nbsp;magazine, stating “After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult&nbsp;decision to divorce.”</p><p>Speaking to the New York Times, Affleck&nbsp;revealed that he started to drink more when cracks began to show in his&nbsp;marriage&nbsp;with Garner. “The&nbsp;biggest regret&nbsp;of my life is this divorce,” he told the magazine.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s just stewing in a toxic, hideous feeling of low self-worth and self-loathing. I have certainly done things that I regret,” he added. “But you’ve got to pick yourself up, learn from it, learn some more, try to move forward.”</p><p>In an interview with Vanity Fair in February 2016, Jennifer Garner directly addressed her husband’s infidelity.</p><p>She confirmed that the couple had been separated for months before “Nannygate” and that Ben’s infidelity had nothing to do with the decision for a split.</p><p>“Bad judgment? Yes. It’s not great for your kids for [a nanny] to disappear from their lives.”</p><p>This was probably one of the more regrettable outcomes for the devoted mother. When talking about her children, Garner revealed, “I have had to have conversations about the meaning of ‘scandal.'”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Moving on</h2><p>Almost a year later,&nbsp;unnamed sources told People magazine that Affleck and Garner called off their divorce, although they weren’t back together.</p><p>Garner realized long ago that she couldn’t change Affleck, even after she supported him as he recovered from his alcohol abuse and <a href=#>gambling addiction</a>. Her support and understanding were the reason she held off on the split.</p><p>However, on April 13, 2017, the couple officially filed for divorce.</p><p>Her&nbsp;children&nbsp;have been her number one priority throughout the&nbsp;divorce. Divorce and separation are disruptive, and children are often the first to suffer as a consequence.</p><p>Despite all of the ups and downs, Jen’s commitment to Ben and her&nbsp;family&nbsp;is an incredible act of kindness and love.</p><p>She did not expect this reality as she walked down the aisle at their beach wedding, but she has already accepted that they will have to deal with the situation at hand, and not dwell on the past events that led them to this place.</p><p id=ent-52>In October 2018, Ben revealed to his Instagram followers that he recently completed a&nbsp;40-day stay&nbsp;at a treatment facility for&nbsp;alcohol addiction.</p><p id=ent-52>In a related Facebook post, the actor wrote, “I have completed&nbsp;treatment for alcohol&nbsp;addiction; something I’ve dealt with in the past and will continue to confront, I want to live life to the fullest and be the best father I can be.”</p><p>Affleck’s romantic life has been making headlines since. He has moved on from his longtime girlfriend Lindsay Shookus and&nbsp;had taken up with 22-year-old Playboy model Shauna Sexton.</p><p>In 2019, he met actress Ana de Armas while filming in New Orleans, Louisiana, on the psychological thriller “Deep Water.” They began dating soon afterward and were often spotted in Los Angeles, California during the pandemic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmnaGUYq%2BmuoyanZ%2BklZi4bq%2FHnpitZZ%2Bjequxzaegn52iYrSivs2eqWg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-ben-affleck-cheat-on-jennifer-garner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-ben-affleck-cheat-on-jennifer-garner.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-ben-affleck-cheat-on-jennifer-garner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-ben-affleck-cheat-on-jennifer-garner.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-ben-affleck-cheat-on-jennifer-garner.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-ben-affleck-cheat-on-jennifer-garner.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-is-jacob-elordis-net-worth-in-2024-find-out-how-much-he-earned-for-euphoria-1272908.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-is-jacob-elordis-net-worth-in-2024-find-out-how-much-he-earned-for-euphoria-1272908.html>What Is Jacob Elordi's Net Worth In 2024?
