A few days later, she was dead at the hands of her ex-husband Alex Kwong and his family. So what happened? Here's everything to know about the horrific situation…</p><h2>Who was Abby Choi?</h2><p id=eOhNDTo5llY data-wc=68>Abby, 28, was an influencer and model who came from a wealthy family. The eldest of three daughters, she tied the knot with her ex-husband Alex when they were both 18, and the pair shared two sons.

The suspects covered the walls of the flat with a sail, and they put on face shields and raincoats so that they would not get bloodstained by dismembering the body."</p><h2>Why was Abby Choi killed?</h2><p id=efHsJQw3LyNh data-wc=42>It has been reported that there was a dispute surrounding a luxury apartment that Abby purchased for the family. Abby began to make plans to sell the apartment, which was registered in her former father-in-law's name in order to avoid stamp duty.</p><p id=eOGKYhNEyklg data-wc=34>She received advice from a lawyer who confirmed that she could sell the property if she provided proof that she paid for it, and the decision was met with resistance from her ex-husband's father.&nbsp;</p><h2>How was Abby Choi found?</h2><p id=ex7J3jLHiduo data-wc=50>Abby's body parts were discovered at a property where she was dismembered and hidden in cooking pots, with officials believing that she suffered a fatal injury from behind struck in the back of her head. A search is currently underway to find her remaining body parts in a nearby landfill.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4bc6b8ff134c-hong-kong-apartment-z.jpg><p id=ecP37o8l3oAf data-wc=6><strong>The apartment where Abby was found</strong></p><p id=ezJFOrNfv1Bh data-wc=42>Superintendent Alan Chung said: "The suspects threw away several bags of important evidence in the morning of 22 February. There may be some human body parts or they could be the clothes and phone of the victim - or even the weapons."</p><p id=eXXIG4vj-lc9 data-wc=15><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#> Sign up to our What to Watch newsletter</a> and get the heads-up on the shows and films everyone’s talking about.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2trYGh9c32Vbm5sa1%2BWr6PFjJyfqKFdosKzsMSrZLCgkal6qa3PqZynnZRitbC6xmaiqKaXYrqwsMSlZKKmlqHCprrCnqlo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fabby-choi-murder-what-happened-hong-kong-model-influencer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fabby-choi-murder-what-happened-hong-kong-model-influencer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fabby-choi-murder-what-happened-hong-kong-model-influencer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fabby-choi-murder-what-happened-hong-kong-model-influencer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fabby-choi-murder-what-happened-hong-kong-model-influencer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fabby-choi-murder-what-happened-hong-kong-model-influencer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./blake-livelys-maternity-style.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./blake-livelys-maternity-style.html>Blake Lively's Unbuttoned Leather Dress Plunged All the Way Down to Her Waist</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./top-father-daughter-wedding-songs.html>40 Great Father-Daughter Dance Songs for a Country Fan's Wedding</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./top-father-daughter-wedding-songs.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
