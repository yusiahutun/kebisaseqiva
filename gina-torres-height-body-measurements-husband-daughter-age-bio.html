She started acting when she realized that college was out of the question, and admittedly it was the right step for her.</p><p>As an American television and film actress, she has won many prestigious awards and has been nominated for many more. She has starred in a variety of series and films including Xena: Warrior Princess, Alias, Angel, 24, Suits, Cleopatra 2525, Westworld, Serenity, I Think I Love My Wife and a host of others. Torres.</p><p>In her younger years, Gina was a mezzo-soprano who performed in a gospel choir.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Gina Torres Bio, Age</strong></h2><p>Born on April 25, 1969, in Manhattan, the actress was the youngest of three children to join her family in Washington Heights. Her two parents (Rebecca and Richard) were of Cuban (multiracial) descent. Besides English, Gina speaks fluent Spanish.</p><p>She received her early education at the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in New York City. She also received training in opera and jazz, which helped her perform in a gospel choir. Although she received many admission offers from various universities, Gina could not fulfill any of them due to financial reasons and decided instead to pursue a career in the arts.</p><p>Shortly after the start of her acting career, she received the ALMA Award for Outstanding Leading Actress in a Syndicated Drama Series in 2001 for her role in Cleopatra 2525, and again she received an award for the Golden Satellite Award from the International Press Academy for the best performance by a supporting actress in a series, Drama 2014, which she received for her portrayal of Jasmine in Angel. In the same year, she appeared in seven episodes of 24 (third season) as Julia Milliken. In 2005, she lent her voice to the character of the vixen in the animated series Justice League Unlimited and also replaced Jada Pinkett Smith for the voice-over of the character of Niobe in The Matrix Online.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Bill O’Reilly Wife And Children, Family, Height, Divorce, Where Is He Now?</a></strong></p><p>At the beginning of her career, she also appeared in blockbuster films such as The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. She was the wife of the character played by Chris Rock in the film I Think I Love My Wife.</p><p>Her role in Fox’s short-lived Firefly series, which only ran for one season, is one of her most popular roles, which she picked up again in the 2005 film Serenity. She was later cast as the main character Jessica Pearson in the right-wing drama Suits. In 2018, she will also play and produce a supporting role in Suits, with her main character Jessica Pearson at the center.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Gina Torres Husband, Daughter</strong></h2><p>Since 2002 Gina Torres has been married to actor Laurence Fishburne, with whom she played a couple in the series, Hannibal, from 2013 to 2015. The two became engaged in February 2001, and their engagement was transformed into a marriage on September 22, 2002, at a ceremony at The Cloisters Museum in New York City.</p><p>In 2007, the couple welcomed their only child together, a daughter named Delilah. Gina also plays the role of stepmother to the two children sired by Fishburne from his previous marriage to actress Hajna O. Moss. Gina’s stepchildren include Langston (son), born in 1987, and Montana (daughter), born in 1991.</p><p>While their relationship seemed rosy and was one of the most admired in Hollywood, their paradise got into trouble in 2016, and in September 2017 the actress went public with the details of her separation from Fishburne. Apparently, they hadn’t been together for a while but decided to make it official in 2017.</p><p>Regardless, Gina said they were in a good place and there was no bad blood between them. Besides, they will be the best parents they can be to their dear daughter.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Jack Ma Wife (Cathy Zhang), Daughter, Son, Family, Height, Bio</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Height and Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>Gina Torres is a rather beautiful woman with a body that would make most women green with envy.
