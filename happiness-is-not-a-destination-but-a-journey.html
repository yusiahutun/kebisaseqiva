Happiness is closely linked to one’s general well-being and feeling of purpose.” Dr. Jalpa Bhuta, Consultant Psychiatrist at Global Hospital in Parel Mumbai, highlighted why some people have a tougher time being happy than others, saying “We always want to be happy, yet happiness is often found within ourselves.

Due to the Covid, our daily routine changed drastically. What we once believed that traveling, meeting new friends are the reason for happiness is no longer it is. But our definition of happiness is totally different from the definition of experts. Let’s hear what they say and a few tips for a path of happiness. Mehezabin Dordi, a clinical psychologist at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital, explained in an interview with HT Lifestyle, that “Joy, pleasure, contentment, and fulfillment are all emotions associated with happiness. Happiness is closely linked to one’s general well-being and feeling of purpose. This positive attitude has a variety of positive effects on a person’s health, both physically and mentally, including positive effects on an individual’s health – such as increased optimism, vitality, improved problem-solving abilities, and having fewer physical ailments, i.e. happiness lowers your risk of cardiovascular disease, lowers your blood pressure, allows for better sleep, improves your diet, and allows you to maintain a normal body weight through regular exercise. It also promotes the development of resilience and enhances attention and cognitive skills.” Dr. Jalpa Bhuta, Consultant Psychiatrist at Global Hospital in Parel Mumbai, highlighted why some people have a tougher time being happy than others, saying “We always want to be happy, yet happiness is often found within ourselves. Learn to control your negative thoughts and view each day with optimism. We often think of happiness as something that tends to happen to us and over which we have no control. It’s simple to equate happiness with our current circumstances, but that’s not how happiness works.” Dr. Sahir Jamati, consultant psychologist and psychotherapist at Mumbai’s Masina Hospital and HOD-Department of Psychology, revealed, “We all agree that the psychological state is complicated and diverse, and that a variety of things can influence someone’s mental health. Positivism and wellbeing include happiness as one of the key components. Despite the fact that happiness is a subjectively emotional element, overall happiness has a beneficial relationship with a variety of mental disorders.”</p><p>“Don’t try to suppress negative thoughts,” Dr. Jalpa Bhuta advised, citing research that reveals only a small part of happiness (about 10%) is dependent on a person’s situation. “I have to stop worrying about this,” you tell yourself, just leading you to think about it even more. Instead, take responsibility for your concerns. Recognize when you’re stuck in a bad loop.”Treat yourself like a friend.” When you’re feeling bad about yourself, think about what advice you’d give a friend who’d been feeling low. Now try to put that advice into practice.”</p><p>&nbsp;Dr. Sahir Jamati asserted that happiness may be chosen and enumerated the steps to do so:</p><ul><li>Resilience is a practical strategy to go forward in life while remaining happy. By developing resilience, I don’t ignore the bad emotions that come with adversity, but rather adapt to unfortunate occurrences and setbacks and rebounding. Developing resilience will not solve your difficulties, but it will assist you in seeing past them.</li><li>Instead of worrying about all the unpleasant things you’re dealing with right now, acknowledge and appreciate the good things that have happened in your life. We should be grateful not only for materialistic or tangible goods, but also for immaterial things like getting a loving partner or fantastic friends, being blessed with children, and so on.</li><li>Changing one’s perspective to see a difficult situation in a different light and coming up with a strong outcome or opportunity as a result. Learning from your mistakes, what made things difficult, and finding a possibly constructive method to better your circumstances will help you feel less sad.</li><li>Remembering earlier challenging circumstances while you were capable of going through them successfully can give you the motivation to improve. Remember that you have overcome adversity before and can do so again. You’ll be able to get through this and get stronger as a result.</li><li>Spend some time doing activities that you enjoy. It’s fine to be having a bad day, as long as you make time to do things that make you happy. You can pursue hobbies such as coin or shell collecting, music, art, gardening, athletics, and so on.</li><li>Use meditation, breathing exercises, or yoga to calm your mind and find some peace. This can help you relax and feel calmer.</li><li>Increasing your activity levels, especially in pleasurable activities, and completing realistic and achievable tasks is another simple opportunity to shift towards happiness.</li></ul><p>If people are unable to handle stress on their own or are experiencing emotional, cognitive, or physical symptoms on a daily basis for more than two weeks, they should seek help from a mental health expert.</p><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">News</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Reading & Math Science Enhance English Learners’ Performance:</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 2, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">News</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>During the perimenopause, women are 40% more prone</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">News</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Bomb Threat in Delhi-NCR Schools: It Can Cause</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">News</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Raghav Juyal advocates for stopping plastic pollution, Urges</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Motivation</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">News</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Appearance over Achievement?: UP Board Topper Trolled for</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sb%2FYnJ%2BopJ%2BcwG%2BvzqZmoZmgpbavsdKsZKKrXaO8tXnAZpueq6Seu6LAyKilZpqlqXqiecmorKumla58</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhappiness-is-not-a-destination-but-a-journey.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhappiness-is-not-a-destination-but-a-journey.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhappiness-is-not-a-destination-but-a-journey.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhappiness-is-not-a-destination-but-a-journey.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhappiness-is-not-a-destination-but-a-journey.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhappiness-is-not-a-destination-but-a-journey.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./girl-vanished-note-strangled-stepfather-sentenced-life-prison-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./girl-vanished-note-strangled-stepfather-sentenced-life-prison-html.html>Inside the harrowing case of 14-year-old 'runaway' Chyenne Kircher whose decomposing body was found</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./asm-global-buys-25-shareholding-in-australian-stadium-operator-venueslive.html>ASM Global Buys 25% Shareholding in Australian Stadium Operator VenuesLive</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./asm-global-buys-25-shareholding-in-australian-stadium-operator-venueslive.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
