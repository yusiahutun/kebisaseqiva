<time>23 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The demand for retro video games has never been stronger, and there’s no denying the enormous amount of old video games being bought and resold every day.</p><p>This boom has led to a rise in the popularity of professional game-grading services. These cater to players wanting expert documentation attesting to their vintage video games’ condition and having them housed in protective cases for posterity.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>But how does the actual grading process work? Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=what-will-the-vga-and-wata-grade>What Will the VGA and Wata Grade?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/vga-front-page-(top).jpg><p>Essentially, video game grading is having an expert examine your sealed retro game and assign it a grade based on how close the condition is to perfect.</p><p>While an increasing number of companies specialize in grading, this article will only refer directly to the two best-known firms—namely the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Video Game Authority</a> (VGA) and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wata Games</a>.</p><p>The VGA grades sealed games and has a separate grading type for unsealed boxes with new contents. Wata will grade everything from sealed to complete in box (CIB) to loose games, depending on the age of the system for which they were released.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>As a rule of thumb, the older the <a href=#>video game generation</a> to which a title belongs, the more chance one of these organizations will consider grading a loose copy.</p><p>Prototypes are a special situation. These tend not to have any packaging created for them since the game isn’t ready for commercial sale at that stage—and may never be! They can be quite rough, and even hand-labeled. Therefore, they are certainly not expected to be boxed and sealed.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=what-won-rsquo-t-the-vga-and-wata-grade>What Won’t the VGA and Wata Grade?</h2><p>Given that any retro market is rooted in nostalgia, graders normally favor games for the more popular classic video game systems from Nintendo, Sega, Sony, and Microsoft. You’re far less likely to find an expert who will grade a title for an obscure system. The demand isn't as high, and the person grading often won't have as much experience using those machines.</p><p>Graders also tend to shy away from oversized games. For one thing, they don’t fit in the usual range of display cases. But perhaps more importantly, if they are a different size and shape—maybe they have a gatefold or a clear window—then their condition is automatically harder to compare with that of regular game boxes.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=are-video-game-ratings-universal>Are Video Game Ratings Universal?</h2><p>No. Wata gives sealed games a score out of 10 for the box and a letter grade (from C up to A++) for the seal. The VGA awards a score from 10 to 100. For CIB games, Wata uses component grades to arrive at the rating, with the following weighting: box 50%, cartridge 30%, manual 20%. Other firms will have their own scale.</p><h2 id=what-do-video-game-graders-look-out-for>What Do Video Game Graders Look Out For?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/scales-and-judges-hammer-symbolizing-the-grading-process.jpg><p>In the eyes of a grader, the ideal game looks like it just came off the production line at the factory. The rating it receives reflects how close it is to this state. In determining a score/grade, the grader will consider several factors, as outlined below.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>While we talk about a singular grader throughout this article, both VGA and Wata state that multiple graders will evaluate a game before arriving at the final verdict to ensure consistency and accuracy. Other reputable companies will do likewise.</p><p>The game grader will first determine whether your game is authentic or fake. Even if the box is genuine, someone could have resealed it. Experienced graders have typically seen enough factory-sealed products to know when this has happened.</p><p>After that, the grader will factor each of the following into their final decision.</p><h3 id=seal-condition>Seal Condition</h3><p>Unfortunately, some games come off the production line with better shrink wrap than others. This is nobody’s fault, but a flawless seal is inarguably superior to a miscut or misaligned one.</p><p>Even if the plastic is intact, the following will inevitably lower a video game's grade:</p><ul><li>Cuts, tears, or holes</li><li>Dents, scratches, or wrinkles</li><li>Yellowing, fading, or clouding</li><li>Ink marks</li></ul><p>Plastic that has been carefully slit open to allow access to the media inside the box is the same as having no seal because someone could have altered the contents.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=box-condition>Box Condition</h3><p>In examining the box, the grader will be looking for signs of crushing, creasing, and cracking. “Puffy corners” are a definite minus.</p><p>If any defect listed in the section about seal conditions applies to the box, this will also lower the game's final grade.</p><h3 id=price-stickers-autographs-hooks-and-security-tags>Price Stickers, Autographs, Hooks and Security Tags</h3><p>Price stickers might not reduce a grade drastically if they don't obscure the game's text or artwork.</p><p>Autographs, unless they were designed to be part of the original product—say for a limited release or special event—are effectively the same as other pen markings. Sure, they might have immense sentimental value to someone. But often, they will lower the video game’s grade a lot.</p><p>Devices added after the game left the factory, such as plastic hooks or non-removable security tags, will also bring down its grade.</p><h2 id=why-are-graded-games-cased-in-plastic>Why Are Graded Games Cased in Plastic?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wata-games-front-page-(lower-section).jpg><p>For a few reasons, the VGA and Wata return graded games to their owners in a clear plastic case. First and foremost, it allows a game to be “frozen” in its present condition while being displayed next to its grading information. Think of it as another way of <a href=#>caring for your retro tech</a>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The design of these plastic cases makes it immediately apparent if they have been opened, adding a layer of reassurance for potential buyers. Lastly, the cases provide a level of ultraviolet (UV) protection.</p><p>While the cases used afford excellent protection against knocks and spills, they normally have a small opening to allow airflow and prevent “sweating”.</p><p>It’s worth mentioning at this point that some graders offer additional services like cleaning and testing before they enshrine your beloved game.</p><h2 id=now-you-know-the-video-game-grading-process>Now You Know the Video Game Grading Process</h2><p>So, now you know how the VGA and Wata grade video games.</p><p>If you’re keen to have your—preferably sealed—vintage titles assessed, the graders are going to be looking for fakes and repairs. They’ll also be checking for a long list of possible defects.</p><p>Eventually, based on in-house scales, comparisons, and discussion, graders will arrive at a rating. Your retro treasure will then be encased in tamper-proof plastic, displaying all the relevant information.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGifqK9dlr%2BmedWim56nXZyurrHSZp6rmZSasXA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-are-video-games-graded.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-are-video-games-graded.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-are-video-games-graded.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-are-video-games-graded.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-are-video-games-graded.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-are-video-games-graded.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hrhcollection.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hrhcollection.html>HRHCollection</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./forget-bluetooth-rf-headphones-are-best-for-tv-and-gaming.html>Forget Bluetooth: RF Headphones Are Best for TV and Gaming</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./forget-bluetooth-rf-headphones-are-best-for-tv-and-gaming.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
