<time>28 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Stanley Sandler is the late father of famous comedy actor Adam Sandler. Adam is one of the most prominent actors in Hollywood, and he has the Awards and net worth to prove it.&nbsp;</p><p>However, without Stanley Sandler, the world may have never gotten to experience Adam’s acting. At best, the actor may have ended up a soldier fighting for justice in some drab landscape filled with death.&nbsp;</p><p>His father played a significant role in discouraging him from becoming a soldier, among many other things, and Adam has never forgotten him since his demise. Keep reading to learn more about Stanley and his beautiful relationship with Adam.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/dad-sandler.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Stanley_Sandler_Biography></span>Stanley Sandler Biography&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Adam Sandler’s father, Stanley Sandler, was born on April 5, 1935, in Brooklyn, Kings County, New York, USA.&nbsp;Philip Sandler and Anna Sandler, Adam’s grandparents, brought him into the world. While he lived, Stanley worked as an electrical engineer while he raised his family.&nbsp;</p><p>He was a true family man who did not take his duty as a father lightly or too seriously. He was married to only one woman, Adam’s mother, Judith “Judy” Levine, a nursery school teacher and an occasional actress thanks to her son.&nbsp;</p><p>Some movies her son Judy has appeared in include “I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry” (2007), “Blended” (2014), and “Hotel Transylvania” (2012). Stanley appeared less often because Adam had not achieved the fame he has now while his father lived. The only movie he got to act in alongside his son was “Eight Crazy Nights.” He played Davey’s dad.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened_to_Stanley_Sandler></span>What Happened to Stanley Sandler?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Stanley Sandler lost his life to lung cancer in 2003. His death hit his family hard, especially Adam, who was very close to him.&nbsp;However, they have kept him alive in their memories and with their tributes. Adam is notorious for how often he pays tribute to his late father.</p><p>He does it on social media, in interviews, and in his movies. At the end of “50 First Dates,” released one year after Stanley’s demise, Adam slotted a heartwarming tribute to his father.&nbsp;</p><p>The dedication read:&nbsp;“This movie is dedicated to Stanley Sandler. My father, my mentor, my teacher, my coach, my idol, my hero, my family’s leader, my mom’s best friend, and by far the coolest guy I have ever known. We will miss you daily, but we will always try to make you proud.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Old_Was_Stanley_Sandler_When_He_Died></span>How Old Was Stanley Sandler When He Died?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Stanley Sandler passed on at age 68, on September 9, 2003, in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, USA.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mommma-sand.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Stanley_Sandler_Influenced_Adams_Love_for_Comedy></span>Stanley Sandler Influenced Adam’s Love for Comedy<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>One of the essential things that Stanley Sandler and his wife <a href=#>gave</a> to Adam was his love for comedy.&nbsp;Initially, he wanted to be a soldier, but his father never truly believed him. He would always scoff at the idea, often calling him a coward in colorful language, and eventually, Adam realized he was.&nbsp;</p><p>No longer interested in going to the battlefront, Adam started to develop an appreciation for comedy, which his parents enjoyed. Growing up, he loved the comedians his parents loved and watched shows with them. When the time came to tell them he dreamed of acting, Stanley and his wife supported Jim.&nbsp;</p><p>His mother immediately believed that he would do well, but his father was more pessimistic and would often look at his son as crazy when the boy would talk about making it as an actor.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, Stanley supported him, even stopping by on his way from work to “make sure the shooting was going well.” With such fantastic support, it is unsurprising Adam became as successful as he is now.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/sler.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Stanley_Sandlers_Family></span>Stanley Sandler’s Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He and his wife, Judy, are Jewish and descended from Russian-Jewish immigrants. They loved each other immensely, and their relationship served as a blueprint for Adam’s successful marriage, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Stanley welcomed four children with Judy before he died in 2003. Including Adam, there were two boys and two girls: Scott Sandler, Valerie Sandler, and Elizabeth Sandler.&nbsp;</p><p>Other celebrities with tight bonds with their fathers include Ben Stiller, Blake Lively, and <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kwLWtzaWcsmWjlruluMSrZKGnp2K8rbCMsJisZaOprq%2B4xLJkrJmembmmvoywn56mXZ2ybrDInpto</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstanley-sandler-how-old-was-stanley-sandler-when-he-died.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fstanley-sandler-how-old-was-stanley-sandler-when-he-died.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fstanley-sandler-how-old-was-stanley-sandler-when-he-died.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fstanley-sandler-how-old-was-stanley-sandler-when-he-died.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstanley-sandler-how-old-was-stanley-sandler-when-he-died.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstanley-sandler-how-old-was-stanley-sandler-when-he-died.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./suki-waterhouse-shares-pictures-of-dreamy-babymoon-in-st-lucia-with-fiance-robert-pattinson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./suki-waterhouse-shares-pictures-of-dreamy-babymoon-in-st-lucia-with-fiance-robert-pattinson.html>Suki Waterhouse shares pictures of dreamy babymoon in St Lucia with fiance Robert Pattinson</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./manager-employee-of-strip-club-charged-with-possession-of-cocaine.html>Manager, employee of strip club charged with possession of cocaine</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./manager-employee-of-strip-club-charged-with-possession-of-cocaine.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
