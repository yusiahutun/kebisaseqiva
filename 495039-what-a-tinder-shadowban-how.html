However, you notice that you have swiped too much for days without getting any matches. You try different things to get the best results, including changing your photos and rewriting your bio, but everything seems to stay the same. What is the problem? In such a case, there is a high chance that you are a victim of a Tinder shadowban.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e168df0b1ccbc095.jpg><p class=align-left>A Tinder shadowban is a form of punishment used by the dating app to limit user visibility. In most cases, people get a shadowban if they have violated Tinder guidelines and regulations.</p><p class=align-left>Unlike other forms of punishment, a shadowban is more of a silent form of punishment because Tinder does not notify users that they have been shadowbanned. Once you get shadowbanned, your profile becomes invisible to other users, meaning nobody will see your swipes, messages, or likes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/221ab161495df6bb.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Unique bio for Instagram for girls to show attitude, class, and style</span></p></a><h2>Why do I have a Tinder shadowban?</h2><p class=align-left>Tinder will never inform you that it has shadowbanned your account. However, you will get a Tinder shadowban because of the following reasons.</p><h3>A user reported your account</h3><p class=align-left>Generally, it is not possible to know why a user reported you on Tinder since they can give any reason. However, a person likely reported you for inappropriate behaviour, like sending inappropriate messages or making inappropriate <a href=#>comments</a>. Also, a user can report you for behaving in a way that made them uncomfortable.</p><p class=align-left>After reporting you, your account will no longer appear in the person’s match list or anywhere while swiping. In <a href=#>other words</a>, Tinder will shadowban your account to ensure the other user that reported you does not see it.</p><h3>You violated community guidelines</h3><p class=align-left>Tinder has community guidelines to ensure that everyone using the app feels respected. These guidelines include refraining from using profanity, inappropriate language, or any other type of offensive behaviour. Additionally, Tinder expects users to refrain from sending unsolicited sexual messages, sharing obscene images, and engaging in harassment or bullying.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/eaac413b3599cac6.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Snapchat ban: How to get your account or device unbanned</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>dating app </a>will first investigate your account if you violate community guidelines. In the process, it will shadowban your account, making it impossible for you to get a match. The worst-case scenario is whereby Tinder suspends your account indefinitely or deletes it.</p><h3>Your account is inactive</h3><p class=align-left>Tinder encourages users to use the application to find their perfect match. You can use the app all the time to communicate with potential suitors. However, you will get a shadowban if your account remains inactive. And according to Tinder’s community guidelines, the dating app will delete your account for inactivity if you do not log in to your account in two years.</p><h3>You have multiple accounts</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/221ab161495df6bb.png><p class=align-left>A Tinder account cannot have multiple owners. For example, you cannot create an account with your friend or significant other. Furthermore, you cannot maintain multiple<a href=#> Tinder accounts</a>. Tinder will shadowban you if its algorithms detect you are using multiple or joint accounts to find a match.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/84b8d3598e2d2858.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to write a letter to your friend inviting him to attend your birthday party</span></p></a><h3>Your profile pictures are inappropriate</h3><p class=align-left>You may think that you have posted the prettiest picture on Tinder that others will like. For example, posting a picture of your muscled body may seem right. However, some users may find it too sexual. Therefore, know the limits of sexual pictures before posting them.</p><h3>You swipe too much</h3><p class=align-left>Swiping too much on Tinder can lead to several problems. Ideally, when swiping too much, the Tinder algorithm will detect you are too indiscriminate in your swiping. As a result, it will decrease your matches or lower your visibility.</p><p class=align-left>Swiping too much also leads to a decrease in the quality of your matches. That is because the algorithm cannot determine which profiles are compatible with yours. You can counter these factors by taking breaks between your swipes. Give yourself a day or two before swiping. Alternatively, reply to a match, even if it is through a sentence the person will ignore.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/179a71272e2b2899.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ save the date quotes for a wedding: Best, funny, and cute ideas</span></p></a><h2>How long is a Tinder shadowban?</h2><p class=align-left>A shadowban typically lasts forever. However, many people have speculated that Tinder may have a 3-month rule. In this rule, if you do not log in to your shadowbanned account for three months, Tinder will lift the shadowban. But Tinder has never confirmed this rule. Therefore, the assumption is that a shadowban lasts forever.</p><h2>How do you know if you are shadowbanned on Tinder?</h2><p class=align-left>When Tinder has shadowbanned your account, you will notice different things about your experience on the app. Here are a few:</p><h3>Fewer matches than before</h3><p class=align-left>If you notice that you are getting fewer matches than before, chances are Tinder has shadowbanned your account. Also, if you notice that you are swiping too much and only viewing a limited number of profiles when swiping, consider yourself a victim of a shadowban.</p><h3>Your matches are not responding</h3><p class=align-left>Generally, your matches do not have to respond to you. However, if the responses have reduced compared to previous times, you may be a victim of a Tinder shadowban.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/603b665e99b400d2.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What does it mean when it says user not found on Instagram?</span></p></a><h3>You have received a warning from Tinder</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/eaac413b3599cac6.png><p class=align-left>Tinder sends out warnings when it detects potentially inappropriate behaviour on an account. For example, if you<a href=# title> send messages</a> that a recipient deems offensive or harassing and report you, you will receive a warning from Tinder. Also, you can receive a warning for breaking the terms of service. The warning could culminate in a shadowban or expulsion.</p><h2>Is Tinder shadowban real?</h2><p class=align-left>Yes. It is real because it makes users experience passiveness on the app. For example, you will not get matches, likes, or have others see your messages.</p><h2>Does the Tinder shadowban go away?</h2><p class=align-left>It is impossible to tell whether a shadowban goes away. However, the only way of getting out of it is to delete the account and start a new one. The advantage here is that Tinder ties a shadowban to a user’s account, not their device or IP address. Therefore, you can create a new account and start fresh.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1a9e2ef0db204055.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to fix This page isn't available right now on Facebook</span></p></a><p class=align-left>But creating a new account has its challenges. Here is why:</p><ul><li>You need a new email and phone number.</li><li>You must delete the Tinder app from your device, which will delete the Tinder cache and historical data.</li><li>Download and install the Tinder app.</li><li>Take new pictures.</li></ul><p class=align-left>After creating the account, avoid the temptation of using your old photos. Besides deleting your account, the second method is to consider a lawsuit. However, a Tinder shadowban lawsuit may take a long time and does not guarantee results. The best way is to write to Tinder to request them to lift your shadowban if you suspect the app has imposed a ban on your account.</p><h2>How to avoid getting shadowbanned on Tinder</h2><p class=align-left>Use <a href=#>appropriate language</a> when communicating with others. Avoid offensive language because it can get your account flagged. Also, ensure to follow community guidelines by refraining from sending unsolicited sexual messages, sharing obscene images, and engaging in harassment.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/85d8d5fbaea928ee.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What the Page Not Found Instagram error means and how to fix it</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Once you open a Tinder account, ensure it is not dormant. The app will delete your account if it has been inactive for two years. Also, avoid creating multiple Tinder accounts. Instead, delete your previous account and create a new one. Similarly, avoid using joint accounts because it violates Tinder’s terms and conditions.</p><p class=align-left>A Tinder shadowban is a punishment Tinder uses to limit your visibility on the app. It occurs if you violate community guidelines and regulations. Also, a shadowban can occur if a user reports your account for inappropriate behaviour or if your account has been inactive. Once it shadowbans your account, it will last forever. The only way to get out of it is to delete your account and create a new one.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke shared an article about how to <a href=#>start a conversation on Tinder</a> with a guy.
