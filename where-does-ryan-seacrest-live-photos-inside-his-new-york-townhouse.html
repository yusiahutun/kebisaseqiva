The radio personality has been residing in a huge Manhattan townhouse near his cohost, <a href=#><strong>Kelly Ripa</strong></a>, and he reportedly pays $75,000 a month. He <a href=#>announced he was leaving</a> the show in February 2023. Kelly’s husband, <a href=#><strong>Mark Consuelos</strong></a>, was named as his replacement.</p><p><span>“This is something that [</span>Kelly<span>] and I have been talking about for a long time, and it was a tough, tough decision. Last year we spoke, and I made the decision to make this my last season as cohost,” he said during an episode of the series.</span></p><p>Ryan’s pad is so luxurious that it has six bedrooms, six bathrooms, 9,500 square feet and a master suite that occupies the entire third floor. The <a href=#>American Idol</a> host gave fans an inside look into his humble abode when he posted a video of himself doing jumping jacks at home. “At-home workout using stuff in the kitchen. Fighting calories with calories,” he said in the <a href=#>Instagram clip</a> in March 2020.</p><p>Although his space is big enough for two, Ryan currently lives there alone. He <a href=#>used to share his apartment</a> with his ex-girlfriend, <a href=#><strong>Shayna Taylor</strong></a>, but after they <a href=#>broke up for the third time</a>, the model packed her bags and left.</p><p>“Ryan and Shayna decided to end their romantic relationship amicably some time ago,” his representative told <a href=#>People</a> in June 2020. “They remain good friends, each other’s biggest supporters and will always cherish their time together as a couple.”</p><p>One thing the couple loved about Ryan’s New York residence was his “open” kitchen that they made a lot of meals out of. “It’s definitely got enough space,” he told <a href=#>People</a> in a December 2018 interview.</p><p>“Coming from California we had a lot of space, so we like it for that reason. We also like it because it’s in an open room, so you’re never separated. One of us could be watching something. One of us could be in here, and you could still…” he explained, as Shayna chimed in, “… Talk and feel like you’re connected.”</p><p>However, life on the east coast was a bit of an adjustment for the producer. During a June 2018 interview with <a href=#>The New York Times</a>, Ryan said he always found himself checking the weather because the temperature in New York is nothing like California. But after a few years in the city, the TV host grew accustomed to life in the Big Apple and his luxurious home, which features a rooftop garden and six wood-burning fireplaces.</p><p>“New York and Los Angeles are very special places to me,” he told People. Considering Ryan put his longtime Beverly Hills mansion on the market in late 2020, per <a href=#>Taste of Country</a>, it looks like he may be ready to make New York his full-time home!</p><p><span>In 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ryan converted his space into a full-time work-from-home setup. Not only did he host season 18 of </span><i><span>American Idol</span></i><span> from his living room, but he also led ABC’s </span><i><span>Disney Family Singalong</span></i><span> from the comfort of his own home on multiple occasions.</span></p><p><span>The </span><i><span>Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve</span></i><span> host added some cute Disney touches to his house for the event, including a vintage Disneyland sign and </span><i><span>Beauty and the Beast</span></i><span> figurines. Fans can always count on Ryan to fully commit to each of his jobs, whether it’s decorating his space or wearing a crazy costume.</span></p><p><b>To see photos inside the star’s gorgeous Big Apple apartment, scroll through the gallery below.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn56qlWKxsLHSZqmymZ5iwKatwqucrKxdoba3sYypn6isn6h6qrrSopueZZiewG66xLBksqeioHq1u9ann6ito5p8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhere-does-ryan-seacrest-live-photos-inside-his-new-york-townhouse.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhere-does-ryan-seacrest-live-photos-inside-his-new-york-townhouse.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhere-does-ryan-seacrest-live-photos-inside-his-new-york-townhouse.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhere-does-ryan-seacrest-live-photos-inside-his-new-york-townhouse.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhere-does-ryan-seacrest-live-photos-inside-his-new-york-townhouse.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-does-ryan-seacrest-live-photos-inside-his-new-york-townhouse.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./best-dry-brushes-7484599.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./best-dry-brushes-7484599.html>The 12 Best Dry Brushes of 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./maneskin-damiano-david-apologizes-after-tiktok-video-of-him-kissing-mystery-woman-goes-viral.html>Mneskin's Damiano David Apologizes After TikTok Video of Him Kissing Mystery Woman Goes Viral</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./maneskin-damiano-david-apologizes-after-tiktok-video-of-him-kissing-mystery-woman-goes-viral.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
