Yes, the Online Safety Bill is becoming law and will certainly help keep our children safer, but online dangers will still exist.</p><p id=ePAKTvRRlcD- data-wc=48>Potential end-to-end encryption on social media messaging is a big issue right now – how will I know if my child is talking to a groomer if their messages can't be checked or intercepted? I get the privacy argument, but what about the safety of our precious kids?</p><p id=eUjE8UGXmRUj data-wc=62>We do all we can to monitor our teen and tween's devices: regular 'spot-checks' on their messages and search history without warning, our youngest has no social media, we have downtime and app restrictions set up, no phones at the dinner table (that's all of us) or in bedrooms overnight, location tracking is turned off and message settings are on 'only friends'.</p><p id=eY9UNuU_HQz- data-wc=9><strong>We are trying our best… but it's still scary.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bb08bc41d80b-gaming-online.jpg><p id=e4F4uQ6bdVYJ data-wc=54>Some people will say, 'Just don't give them a phone', but will that help? It's how young people communicate and relate to each other now, and how parents keep in touch with their secondary school kids. By banishing it altogether, will they feel out of touch with their peers? Will that cause other problems?</p><p id=eaw3x798vKiz data-wc=50>Our generation forgets that in our childhood we had landlines to call our friends for a chat. Practically no one has a landline anymore, so how do young people connect with their friends without a mobile phone? <strong>The world has moved on and us parents are trying to keep up.</strong></p><p id=elC93ic7XZQi data-wc=41>The main thing is to keep talking about online safety, learn about the apps as best we can and keep that open conversation going with our children – so if they do have a problem, they feel comfortable talking to us.</p><p id=eTpKKpFIuv1d data-wc=63>However, as Harry and Meghan say, safeguarding our children online shouldn't just be up to us parents; it's also the responsibility of the tech platforms, who we hope will swiftly enforce&nbsp;the Online Safety Bill's new regulations. There are further areas to look at such as social media apps being safer by design, the algorithm settings, and as mentioned, whether messages are encrypted.</p><p id=e1Kg6eMIUxFM data-wc=40><strong>I recently spoke to MP Michelle Donelan, the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology,</strong> who told me that the Online Safety Bill is "a massive leap forward in terms of where we're coming from and where we're going."</p><p id=er2oAkSjvLpA data-wc=31>She added: "But this bill doesn't do everything that everybody would ever want when it comes to the Internet or app design, and there will be future bills in this space."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
