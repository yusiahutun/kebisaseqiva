Written out in the season eight premiere, the character was killed in an off-screen helicopter crash that left fans devastated.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e43741d07526-amy-carlson-donnie-wahlberg-blue-bloods.jpg><p id=ewRtJffcYvh data-wc=53>Speaking to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Deadline</a> in 2017, Amy suggested that while she'd simply decided not to renew her contract, she was surprised by the character's demise, telling the publication: "I feel badly that she dies the way she dies. I did not know they would do that, I was surprised. I wouldn't have done that."</p><p id=eSxp71Ea3qe data-wc=59>Explaining that she was not invited to wrap up the storyline in the season eight premiere, Amy was asked how she would have handled it. "I could've shown the death. I guess It would've been nice for the fans to see her demise, to be a participant in it, and that was my vote for the fans," she noted.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/3d3c45554144-amy-carlson-in-blue-bloods.jpg><p id=eOZZTE9a2eW data-wc=67>"I'm not sure how I would've chosen it but I just know that for the fans to have a way to grieve, to move through it, I think it would've been nice for them. That's just what I hear from them all the time, 'We really want you to come back', and I'm like, that's impossible. But they also say we wish we could've mourned the character."&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Read more</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Inside Donnie Wahlberg's sweet bond with TV 'dad' Tom Selleck" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/02dff5080807-donnie-wahlberg-tom-selleck-pose-together.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Inside Donnie Wahlberg's sweet bond with TV 'dad' Tom Selleck" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Inside Donnie Wahlberg's sweet bond with TV 'dad' Tom Selleck</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Blue Bloods stars Donnie Wahlberg and Bridget Moynahan break silence on show's 'sad' ending" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/91d5be514fcc-donnie-wahlberg-tom-selleck-bridget-moynahan-will-estes.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Blue Bloods stars Donnie Wahlberg and Bridget Moynahan break silence on show's 'sad' ending" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Blue Bloods stars Donnie Wahlberg and Bridget Moynahan break silence on show's 'sad' ending</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Tom Selleck and his Blue Bloods co-stars' salaries revealed – and why they were cut for the show's final season" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/2fda712333ac-tom-blue-bloods.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Tom Selleck and his Blue Bloods co-stars' salaries revealed – and why they were cut for the show's final season" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Tom Selleck and his Blue Bloods co-stars' salaries revealed – and why they were cut for the show's final season</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h2 dir=ltr>Jennifer Esposito</h2><p id=eW1ENAge2XO data-wc=41>Jennifer Esposito played Detective Jackie Curatola in the first three seasons of Blue Bloods but in 2012, her character was written out of the show after showing signs of stress and burnout, prompting her to leave the New York Police Department.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/32580efde2da-jennifer-esposito-blue-bloods.jpg><p id=eXb_XB4hIYT data-wc=29>Before her departure, Jennifer had revealed that she'd been diagnosed with Celiac disease – a serious autoimmune disease which can develop at any age following the consumption of gluten.&nbsp;</p><p id=eqX6NEW4dB8 data-wc=42>The actress had also tweeted about CBS' poor treatment of her following the diagnosis. "CBS…PUT me on unpaid leave and has blocked me from working anywhere else after my doc said you needed a reduced schedule due to celiac," Jennifer previously wrote.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/149e6e1d2a5a-jennifer-esposito-as-jackie-blue-bloods.jpg><p id=eN794cRqos9 data-wc=44>"CBS didn't listen to my doc and I collapsed on set. Which everyone saw! After a week off my doc said I could return to work but CBS implied that I was NOT truly ill and this was a scheme to get a raise!"</p><p id=eUYJwUtqqFct data-wc=72>Responding to her comments, CBS eventually released a statement. "Jennifer has informed us that she is only available to work on a very limited part-time schedule," the network began. "As a result, she's unable to perform the demands of her role and we regretfully had to put her character on a leave of absence . . . We hope that she will be able to return at some point in the future."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d568bcb24891-jennifer-esposito-2011-new-york.jpg><p id=edjGZxlpTAQY data-wc=58>Reflecting on the situation to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Fox News</a> in 2016, Jennifer has since declared that CBS failed to understand the severity of her medical condition. "I have been in the business for 20 years. There has been so many [types] of injustice in this business, but it's what you sign up for; it is what it is," she said.&nbsp;</p><p id=eZvDcMwmWdp3 data-wc=26>"This, though, is something that is not about me.

"I did a Pilot with Tom Selleck, Donnie Wahlberg and Bridget Moyahan and it got picked up by CBS. There's this group called Poll Tracks, they came in and said they felt a woman should be his [Donnie Wahlberg's] partner.&nbsp;</p><p id=ejwl6WnP-WC7 data-wc=59>"It didn't have anything to do with me or my skills but it's what they want. So you go from you're doing a show, to now you're not. So those things and I have to admit, it rocked me for a minute. But I just felt you know what, I gotta get back up refocus and just work harder!"&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Sami Gayle</h2><p id=eLRQ-ApxOVDc data-wc=37>Sami Gayle is known and loved for playing Erin Reagan's daughter, Nicky. After becoming a mainstay on the show, however, the actress began making fewer appearances in series 10 and was notably absent from the 13th instalment.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a967425d09de-sami-gayle-blue-bloods.jpg><p id=erFgiIIpiNgP data-wc=47>As it turned out, Sami had taken a break from Blue Bloods to study for a degree at Columbia University. And, in a nod to the star's latest venture, the show even explained Nicky's absence by having her character focus on her education at the same school!</p><p id=eIYqejt4d47Y data-wc=31>Sami is yet to rule out a return to Blue Bloods and with the series coming to an end this fall, we're hoping she might pop up in the final episodes.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
