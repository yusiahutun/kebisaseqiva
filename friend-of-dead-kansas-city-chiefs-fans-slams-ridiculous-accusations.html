<time>15 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><h2 class=h2>Speculation continues over the mysterious deaths of three men whose bodies were found in their friend's yard two days after watching a football game together.</h2><p>As questions continue to grow surrounding <a href=#><strong>the mysterious deaths of three Kansas City Chiefs fans</strong></a>, family members of the deceased are starting to voice their theories over what happened.</p><p>And those theories, according to surviving friend Jordan Willis' lawyer, are absolutely "ridiculous" and "baseless."</p><p>Clayton McGeeney, 36, David Harrington, 37, and Ricky Johnson, 38, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>reportedly</strong></a> went to Willis' Missouri home on January 7 to watch Kansas City face off against the Los Angeles Chargers. Their bodies were then discovered at Willis' home on January 9, after McGeeney's fianc√©e went to the house, broke in after seeing the mens' cars in the driveway and eventually discovered one body on the porch. Police showed and then found two other bodies in the backyard.</p><p>In the days since, Willis' attorney has continued to speak out, <a href=#><strong>with a somewhat confusing and changing narrative</strong></a> about what happened. First, he claimed Willis last saw the men when they left the house and he went to bed, he later said his client went to bed before they left and then said he misspoke and Willis actually did escort them to the front door. There was also a fifth man at the house that night, who reportedly left before the other three men.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3c4edfcd-27b4-45ab-8716-b48d29e766a0 data-container-ref=toofab:article:3aa10cd1-1b4c-43eb-a38c-4a0c0e304d07 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a0/5by4/2024/01/24/a0b4c62f71934257aefd7d0501382252_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">David Harrington, Clayton McGeeney and Ricky Johnson/Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Mystery Deepens Over Deaths of 3 Men Found In Friend's Yard Days After Watching Chiefs Game Together</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Johnson's family has been pretty vocal over the past couple days, speaking with both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>PEOPLE</strong></a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Fox News Digital</strong></a>, speculating over what they believed could have happened.</p><p>"If I were to give a hypothesis... for the three men to die in the way that they did, something had to have been in their system," Jonathan Price, Johnson's brother, told PEOPLE. "Whether or not it was taken knowingly, I wouldn't answer that. But something was taken because three grown men do not freeze to death at the temperatures that were there at the time with just alcohol involved."</p><p>Johnson's mother, Norma Chester, had a more nefarious take on the situation.</p><p>"Seriously, these were responsible men. How do they go in a backyard and freeze to death, all three of them," she told Fox News Digital. "Something that comes to my mind, this guy wants to brag about how smart he is, he's a scientist. My thoughts are that he concocted something and gave it to all three men. I know I'm just thinking, but how could this have happened?"</p><p>Added Johnson's father, Rickie Johnson Sr.: "I believe he drugged them, dragged them outside and waited two days to call police."</p><p>Johnson Sr. said that while his son "may have done some drugs and stuff in the past," he didn't believe the three men "did drugs and fell over dead in that backyard" -- adding, "he wasn't so irresponsible that he was going to go outside and freeze to death."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0cb47cba-6c3c-4d4b-a2df-844c0a19ee1f data-container-ref=toofab:article:3aa10cd1-1b4c-43eb-a38c-4a0c0e304d07 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/85/5by4/2024/01/24/85acfe258e1c4ff09c607b0cfe1db337_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">San Francisco Police Department</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Pair Convicted for Gruesome Murder of Man They Tortured, Injected with Fentanyl and Stuffed In Suitcase</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The Kansas City Police Department has been adamant that the case isn't being investigated as a homicide and said they don't suspect foul play or any "threats or concerns for the surrounding community at this time." They went on to call Willis "cooperative with detectives," while pointing out that no charges have been made and nobody is in custody. Toxicology reports should be available in the coming weeks; police are still awaiting a cause of death as well.</p><p>John Picerno, an attorney representing Willis, called the drugging allegations completely "ridiculous" in a statement to Fox News Digital.</p><p>"He's a scientist, and somehow he's to blame? That's an opinion not based in fact," he told the outlet. "There's no allegation of any animosity between Jordan and his three friends. People want to speculate, [but] it's not like anyone ever called the police saying, 'We're afraid of this Jordan guy.'"</p><p>"They went to watch the Chiefs game together. Jordan had bought four tickets to the Chiefs game for the following Sunday so they could go together," Picerno added. "I understand that people are hurting, but that's no excuse to throw baseless accusations at Jordan."</p><p>He also added that the three men were his client's "buddies" -- and said that had Willis known they were in "danger," he would have "helped them" and "called the police himself." Picerno added, "Anything beyond that is pure speculation."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f5e54772-e400-460a-bb9e-ea467125d172 data-container-ref=toofab:article:3aa10cd1-1b4c-43eb-a38c-4a0c0e304d07 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7f/5by4/2024/01/22/7f52da6e26c6458d899aaaf73fe5ef88_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Gulfport Police Department</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Woman Charged with Son's Murder After Cops Find His Body In Box Behind 'False Wall'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pma21fm7%2Bqsc2dZKieXZmyorCMpJinq5GoeqS107JknKCZmrO0ecWapaxlo6Gurr%2BMq6CdoZOqubDB0maYnJulqK61tc6nqmg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffriend-of-dead-kansas-city-chiefs-fans-slams-ridiculous-accusations.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffriend-of-dead-kansas-city-chiefs-fans-slams-ridiculous-accusations.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffriend-of-dead-kansas-city-chiefs-fans-slams-ridiculous-accusations.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffriend-of-dead-kansas-city-chiefs-fans-slams-ridiculous-accusations.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffriend-of-dead-kansas-city-chiefs-fans-slams-ridiculous-accusations.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffriend-of-dead-kansas-city-chiefs-fans-slams-ridiculous-accusations.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nigella-lawson-edible-christmas-tree-decorations-cookies.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nigella-lawson-edible-christmas-tree-decorations-cookies.html>Nigella Lawson's edible Christmas tree decorations are too beautiful for words</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./532299-equitel-eazzy-loan-limit-explained-ways-increase.html>Equitel Eazzy Loan limit explained (and ways to increase it)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./532299-equitel-eazzy-loan-limit-explained-ways-increase.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
